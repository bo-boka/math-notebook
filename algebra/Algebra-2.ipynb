    "#### Square Roots Review\n",
    "* Every positive number has two square roots, a positive one and a negative one, as illustrated by the Square Root Property: if $x^2 = k$, then $x=\\sqrt{k}$ or $x = -\\sqrt{k}$ or $x = \\pm\\sqrt{k}$. Looking at the logic of powers, 2 positive multiples equal a positive, but 2 negative multiples also equal a positive, e.g. $5^2 = 25$ and $(-5)^2 = 25$. Thus, 25 has 2 square roots.\n",
    " * The positive square root, aka the **pricipal square root** is represented with the radical symbol, $\\sqrt{x}$ where x is called the radicand, \n",
    "   * e.g. $\\sqrt{25} = 5$\n",
    " * The negative square root is represented by placing a minus symbol in front of  the radical sign, $-\\sqrt{x}$,   \n",
    "   * e.g. $-\\sqrt{25} = -5$.\n",
    "* Negative numbers have no square roots that are real numbers for the same reason positives have 2 square roots: positive multiples result in a positive while negative multiples also result in a positive. \n",
    " * There is no real number that can be squared to result in a negative product, $\\sqrt{-x} \\neq\\mathbb{R}$ \n",
    "   * e.g. $\\sqrt{-25} \\neq\\mathbb{R}$, i.e. has no real number solution.\n",
    "* Zero has only one square root, which is 0, i.e. $\\sqrt{0} = 0$ because $0^2 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Root Properties Review\n",
    "* **Product Property of Roots**: If two radicals have the same index number, you can multiply them under the same radical sign. I.e. if a, b are non-negative real numbers, then $\\sqrt[n]{xy} = \\sqrt[n]{x} * \\sqrt[n]{y}$\n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt[3]{3} * \\sqrt[3]{2} = \\sqrt[3]{2 * 3} = \\sqrt[3]{6}$\n",
    "* **Quotient Property of Roots**: If the index, n, is even, x and y represent any **nonnegative** real number and y does not equal 0. If the index, n, is odd, x and y represent any real number and y does not equal 0. I.e. $\\sqrt[n]{\\frac{x}{y}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[n]{x}}{\\sqrt[n]{y}}$ (The indices must be the same).\n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5}$\n",
    " * Example: $\\frac{\\sqrt{50}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{5}} = \\sqrt{10}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplifying Roots Review\n",
    "* A square root is considered simplified if its radicand contains no perfect square factors.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt{32}$ is not simplified because one of 32's factors, 16, is a perfect square factor ($4^2$).\n",
    "* When factors of the radicand have exponents that match the index, the power & radical cancel each other out.\n",
    "* We can use the Product Property of Roots to split up a radical into factors that produce a perfect square or perfect factor and placing the root in front of the remaining radical.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt{98} = \\sqrt{49} * \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{7^2} * \\sqrt{2} = 7\\sqrt{2}$\n",
    "* Can also use prime factorization, removing duplicates that amount to the index, and placing the single factor in front of the radical sign, and multiplying outside & inside the radical.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt{1260} = \\sqrt{2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7} = \\sqrt{2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7} = 2 * 3\\sqrt{5 * 7} = 6\\sqrt{35}$\n",
    "* When simplifying variables with exponents, this same rules applies. Variables with powers of 2 are perfect square factors if it is a square root. When factoring the variable under the radicand, group together variables in amounts that match the index to be moved to the outside of the radical.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt{x^5} = \\sqrt{x * x * x * x * x} = \\sqrt{x^2 * x^2 * x} = x * x\\sqrt{x} = x^2\\sqrt{x}$\n",
    "* The logic ends up being the same as if you grouped variable factors into an exponent multiple of the radical index, then divide it by the index and move it outside of the radical.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt[3]{24x^7} = \\sqrt[3]{2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * x^6 * x} = 2x^2\\sqrt[3]{3x}$\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt[3]{24x^7} = \\sqrt[3]{8x^6} * \\sqrt[3]{3x} = 2x^2\\sqrt[3]{3x}$\n",

    "## Higher Degrees & Powers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Higher Powers\n",
    "* Powers higher than squared or cubed are called $n^{th}$ powers.\n",
    "* Generally, if the exponent $\\leq 3$, apply the exponent. If the exponent $\\geq3$, leave the answer in exponential form.\n",
    "* Are grouped into odd vs even powers because of the logic implication with negatives.\n",
    " * Higher powers that are **even** numbers operate similarly to square powers (because 2 is even) in that the product will always be positive whether or not the base is positive or negative. Negative products are impossible.\n",
    " * Higher powers that are **odd** numbers will always have a negative product if the base is negative, and always have a positive product if the base is positive.\n",
    "* Thus variables with even exponents may have 2 possible solutions for the variable, which can be specified using absolute value symbols. Variables with odd exponents will only have one solution, which can be either positive or negative depending on the sign of the variable's value. Ex:\n",
    " * For $x^4 = 16$, the solution is $x = 2$ **or** $x = -2$.\n",
    "   * For $|x|^4 = 16$, the solution is $x = 2$.\n",
    " * For $x^4 = -16$, is **impossible** for real numbers.\n",
    " * For $x^5 = 243$, the solution is $x = 3$.\n",
    " * For $x^5 = -243$, the solution is $x = -3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Higher Degrees\n",
    "* Degrees of roots that exceed square(2) and cubed(3) are called the $n^{th}$ root of a number.\n",
    " * If $b^n=a$, then b is an $n^{th}$ root of a.\n",
    " * The principal $n{th}$ root of a is written $\\sqrt[n]{x}$ where the n is called the **index** or **degree** of the radical.\n",
    "* Higher degrees that are **even** have the same logic as square roots: \n",
    " * Every positive number with an even root degree has two $n^{th}$ roots, one positive & one negative.\n",
    " * Negative numbers with even root degrees don't have any (real number) roots.\n",
    "* Higher degrees that are **odd** have different logic:\n",
    " * Every positive number with an odd root degree will have only 1 positive root.\n",
    " * Every negative number with an odd root degree will have only 1 negative root.\n",
    "   * Thus, unlike with square roots, negative numbers with odd root degrees will have a root, e.g. $\\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$\n",
    "* Example: \n",
    " * $\\sqrt[4]{16} = 2$\n",
    " * $-\\sqrt[4]{16} = -2$\n",
    " * $\\sqrt[4]{-16}$ is **impossible** for real numbers.\n",
    " * $\\sqrt[5]{243} = 3$\n",

    "## Simplifying Radicals\n",
    "A radical expression is considered simplified if there are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. No factors in the radicand that have perfect powers of the index.\n",
    " 2. No fractions in the radicand.\n",
    " 3. No radicals in the denominator of a fraction.\n",
    " \n",
    "* As with square roots that are simplified when there are no perfect square factors in the radicand, higher degree radical expressions are considered simplified when the radicand has no factors that are powers of its index. I.e. For real numbers a and m, and $n \\ge 2$, $\\sqrt[n]{a}$ is considered simplified if a has no factors of $m^n$. \n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt[3]{24}$ has a factor of 8, which is a perfect cube factor, i.e. $2^3$. Notice that 3 is the index of the radical.\n",
    "* In addition to the review section above, there is additional logic not previously considered for variables with exponents under the radical that is specific to cases where the domain includes solutions of negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplifying Variables with Exponents under Radicals\n",
    "* When simplifying expressions with variables that have powers, if the radical degree is even and the result has an odd exponent, absolute value symbols are placed around it. If the domain is specified as $x \\ge 0$, absolute value signs are not needed since x cannot be negative. See logic below.\n",
    "* Radicals that have variable expressions with even exponents require a specification of logic using absolute value symbols.\n",
    " * For any integer $n \\ge 2$,\n",
    "   * when the index, n, is odd: $\\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a$\n",
    "   * when the index n is even: $\\sqrt[n]{a^n} = |a|$\n",
    "* A radical that has the same degree as the exponent of its radicand might be expected to have a solution that is the radicand since the power and root cancel each other out. But this has an exception. This is true for odd degrees with positive or negative bases, but only true for even degrees with positive bases. It's not true for even degrees with negative bases since even powers render the same product whether or not the base is positive or negative:\n",
    " * Odd & Positive: $\\sqrt[3]{4^3} = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$ \n",
    " * Odd & Negative: $\\sqrt[3]{(-4)^3} = \\sqrt[3]{-64} = -4$\n",
    " * Even & Positive: $\\sqrt{4^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$\n",
    " * Even & Negative: $\\sqrt{(-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$ \n",
    "   * Notice in this last case $-4 \\neq 4$\n",
    "* A variable that has an even exponent may be either a positive or negative number, i.e. 2 possible solutions for x, but the product will always be positive. Thus, when taking the root of that variable's product from a radical, it will always be positive. This is illustrated using absolute value symbols on the result.\n",
    " * Examples: \n",
    "   * $\\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$\n",
    "   * $\\sqrt[4]{x^4} = |x|$\n",
    "   * $\\sqrt[5]{x^5} = x$\n",
    "* We can simplify variables with exponents under the radical even if the exponent and root degree are not the same. Use any method to simplify the radical (covered in Pre-Algebra notebook). Wrap the remaining factor in absolute value symbols **only if** the remaining exponent is odd because an even exponent will already be positive. Thus, absolute value symbols are only necessary if the index is even **and** the result is odd. \n",
    " * Examples:\n",
    "   * $\\sqrt{x^6} = \\sqrt{x^{3*2}} = \\sqrt{(x^3)^2} = |x^3|$\n",
    "     * Note same: $\\sqrt{x^6} = \\sqrt{x*x*x*x*x*x} = |x|\\sqrt{x*x*x*x} = x^2\\sqrt{x*x} = |x^3|$\n",
    "   * $\\sqrt{y^{16}} = \\sqrt{(y^8)^2} = y^8$ (since 8 is even, no absolute value symbols are required.)\n",
    "* Don't wrap coefficients. If there are two variables, wrap both.\n",
    "   * $\\sqrt{16r^{22}} = 4|r^11|$\n",
    "   * $-\\sqrt{81c^2} = -9|c|$\n",
    "   * $\\sqrt[3]{64p^{63}q^9} = 4|p^{21}q^3|$\n",

    "   \n",
    "## Rational Exponents \n",
    "* Rational exponents are when the exponent is a fraction, aka fractional exponent, and these can also be expressed as radicals.\n",
    " * Can convert depending on the situation, making expressions easier to simplify or operate.\n",
    "* Can be written in inline form, $a^{x/y}$, to avoid possible confusion in fractional form, $a^{\\frac{x}{y}}$.\n",
    "* Consider parenthesis:\n",
    " * When converting variables with coefficients from radicals to rational exponents, use parenthesis around the entire base expression, keeping the exponent outside, since the entire expression is raised to the rational power. But only for the expression under the radical.\n",
    " * Negative bases with parenthesis will have negative sign under radical. Thus, index must be odd.\n",
    " * Negative bases without parenthesis will have negative sign before radical. Thus, it is the negative root.\n",
    " * Radicals with exponents are the same with or without parenthesis.\n",
    "* Negative rational exponents are first converted with negative exponents rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit Fractions as Exponents\n",
    "* The denominator of the rational exponent is the index of the radical.\n",
    "* If $\\sqrt[n]{a}$ is a real number and $n \\ge 2$, then $a^{\\frac{1}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]{a}$.\n",
    " * Logic: \n",
    "   * When finding p in $(8^p)^3 = 8$, use Power Property to simplify: $8^{3p} = 8$.\n",
    "   * Since the bases are the same, $8^{3p} = 8^1$, the exponents must be equal: $3p = 1$.\n",
    "   * After simplifying, $p = \\frac{1}{3}$, and plugging: $\\left(8^\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = 8$\n",
    "   * And we already know that: $\\left(\\sqrt[3]{8}\\right)^3 = 8$.\n",
    "   * Thus: $8^\\frac{1}{3} = \\sqrt[3]{8}$.\n",
    "* Convert rational exponents to radicals.\n",
    " * Ex: $25^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\n",
    "* Convert radicals to rational exponents.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt{5y} = (5y)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n",
    " * Ex: $3\\sqrt[4]{5z} = 3(5z)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n",
    "* Negative bases are converted depending on parenthesis. A negative base wrapped in parenthesis cannot have a fractional exponent with an even denominator.\n",
    " * Ex: $(-16)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt[4]{-16}$, which is not a real solution since even roots can't have negative radicands.\n",
    " * Ex: $-16^{\\frac{1}{4}} = -\\sqrt[4]{16}$, is the negative root and will have a negative solution, -2.\n",
    "* Negative fractional exponents are first simplified using the negative exponents rule, then converted to radicals.\n",
    " * Ex: $(16)^{-\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{16^{\\frac{1}{4}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{16}} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Higher Fractions as Exponents\n",
    "* The denominator of the rational exponent is the index of the radical, and the numerator is an additional exponent on the radical.\n",
    "* For any positive integers m and n, $a^{\\frac{m}{n}} = (\\sqrt[n]{a})^m$ **and** $a^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]{a}^m$\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt{y^3} = y^{\\frac{3}{2}}$\n",
    " * Ex: $(\\sqrt[4]{2x})^3 = (2x)^{4/3}$\n",
    "* Per the definition, parenthesis don't matter on the radical.\n",
    "* Usually easier to take the root first to keep the radicand smaller.\n",
    " * Ex: $125^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{125}^2 = 5^2 = 25$\n",
    "* Negative bases are evaluated outside of expression & thus will always be negative, despite the additional exponent.\n",

    "## Adding/Subtracting Radicals\n",
    "* As with all monomials, radicals can only be combined if they are like terms, called **like radicals**.\n",

    " * Ex: $6\\sqrt[3]{7mn} + \\sqrt[3]{7mn} = 7\\sqrt[3]{7mn}$\n",
    "* Simplifying radicals first may create like radicals if they didn't appear to be before.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt[4]{48} - \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt[4]{243}$\n",

    "   * Operate: $\\sqrt[4]{3} - 2\\sqrt[4]{3} = -\\sqrt[4]{3}$\n",
    "* Remember to simplify the radicals even if they cannot be combined.\n",

    " \n",
    "## Multiplying Radicals\n",
    "* Radicals must have the same index to be multiplied. \n",
    "* To multiply roots, multiply the coefficients and multiply the radicands.\n",
    "* For larger numbers, it's easier to combine them by listing their factors to find easier ways to simplify.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\left(2\\sqrt[4]{20y^2}\\right)\\left(3\\sqrt[4]{28y^3}\\right) = 6\\sqrt[4]{2 * 2 * 5 * 2 * 2 * 7 * y^4 * y} = 6(2)y\\sqrt[4]{5 * 7 * y} = 12|y|\\sqrt[4]{35y}$\n",
    "* Radicals can be multiplied with constants because they can be converted to like indices. But they are multiplied as coefficients would be. Logic below, but instead of doing the process, simply treat the constant as a coefficient.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt[3]{9} * 5 = \\sqrt[3]{9} * \\sqrt[3]{5^3} = \\sqrt[3]{3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 5} = 5\\sqrt[3]{9}$\n",
    "* When multiplying a square root by itself, the answer is just the base.\n",

    "* To shorten this process for larger numbers, you can create equivalents with factors instead of multiplying repeatedly by itself. Notice in the third step, the radicand, 4, was factored to $2^2$ so we can clearly see how many missing powers we will need to multiply by & we're multiplying by a much smaller number rather than $4^3$, giving us smaller numbers in both the numerator & denominator. \n",
    " * $\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{5}{64}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{5}}{2\\sqrt[4]{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{5}}{2\\sqrt[4]{2^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{5}\\left(\\sqrt[4]{2^2}\\right)}{2\\sqrt[4]{2^2}\\left(\\sqrt[4]{2^2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{5(4)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{20}}{4}$\n",

    "* Using 2 as a base in an exponential expression is essentially doubling repeatedly by the index value. \n",
    "* When looking at growth as a function of time, if the original value is 1 and it doubles, that is a 100% growth. If the resulting value doubles like that for each time period, the 100% growth rate, or double growth, can be written as $(1+1)^x$, where the 1st integer of 1 represents 100% of the starting value, the 2nd integer 1 is its 100% growth rate, and x is the number of time periods.\n",
    " * So $2^x$ can also be written as $(1+1)^x$.\n",
    " * A 50% growth rate is written as $(1+0.5)^x$.\n",

    "* We can adjust the initial value, rate, and time using the **geometric growth formula**: $f(t) = a(1 + r)^t$, where '$a$' is the initial value at time 0 or $f(0)$, and $r$ is the growth rate, and $t$ is the number of time periods.\n",
    " * Another form emphasizes the initial value in relation to the function: $x_t = x_0(1 + r)^t$, where the initial value is represented by x at t=0 and the output of the function is x at t.\n",
    "* $(1 + r)$ is called the **growth factor**.\n",
    "* Another common form of the **growth formula**: $f(t) = a * b^t$, where the growth factor is written as $b$.\n",
    "* This is called geometric growth because it has a discrete domain and the function values form a geometric progression. Thus, it can be represented with a bar graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Common Ratio\n",
    "* Another common form is $A = a * b^x$. \n",
    "* For exponential growth functions that use some base, $b$, rather than the (1 + r), $b$ is called the growth multiplier, **growth factor**, or the **common ratio**, which is the amount between each number in a geometric progression or **geometric sequence**.\n",
    "* A function has a common ratio when the ratios of outputs, over equal domain intervals, are equal.\n",
    "* It can be found by dividing an element in a geometric sequence by the number preceding it: $\\frac{h(n+1)}{h(n)}$.\n",

    "## Compounded Growth\n",
    "* For data that has a more continuous growth model, we need to account for what's happening in between the abrupt doubling, for which compounding is used.\n",
    "* The growth rate is split into equivalent time periods: $(1 + \\frac{1}{n})^n$, where the 1st integer of 1 is the starting value, the unit 1 represents 100% growth, and n is the number of time periods and the growth divisor.\n",
    " * Instead of applying it all at once, it's applied partially and gradually, applying less growth more often.\n",
    "* BUT the outcome is more than if we were to just double it once because we're including the new growth in the calculation for the next growth.\n",
    " * Splitting into 2 time periods splits the growth to 50% applied twice, $(1 + \\frac{1}{2})^2 = 2.25$ rather than the simple double equaling 2.\n",
    "* When continuing to compound in this way, the the value grows. As n grows, so too does the value.\n",
    " * If n = 4 time periods of 25% growth, $(1 + \\frac{1}{4})^4 = 2.44$, and is more than the previous.\n",

    "## Continuous Growth\n",
    "* Compounding growth has a higher result than geometric growth, but it does not grow forever. No matter how many times it is compounded, the result never gets to 3. \n",
    "* It begins to converge around a number becoming an irrational number with infinite, non-repeating decimals, called the natural base.\n",
    "\n",

    "* The number $e$ is defined as the value of $(1+\\frac{1}{n})^n$, as n increases without bound. As $n$ approaches infinity, $e \\approx 2.7182818284...$\n",
    " * This is an irrational constant known as $e$, aka **Euler's number** (not to be confused with Euler's constant), thought to be one of the 5 major numbers in all mathematics, alongside $0, 1, \\pi, i$\n",
    "* In other words, the natural base, $e$, is the maximum result after continuously compounding a 100% growth over one time period.\n",
    "* It's used to model growth in a natural, continuous way and is found frequently & unavoidably in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous Growth Formula\n",
    "* We can adjust the initial value, rate, time, and compounding periods using the **continuous growth formula**: $f(t) = a * e^{rt}$, where $f(t)$ is the resulting value at a given time, $t$, and $a$ is the initial value, and $e$ is the natural base, and $r$ is the growth rate.\n",
    " * The growth factor here is represented as $e^r$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Growth\n",
    "* In reality, initial exponential growth is often not sustained forever. After some period, it will be slowed by external or environmental factors.\n",
    "* Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored negative feedback factors become significant (leading to a logistic growth model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential Decay\n",
    "* Exponential growth has a positive rate of growth and exponential decay has a negative rate of growth. \n",
    "* Therefore, if we're finding the decay, we subtract r from 1 rather than adding it.\n",
    "* For the geometric form of growth, $f(t) = a(1 + r)^t$, when representing decay the formula becomes $f(t) = a(1 - r)^t$. Therefore, for exponential growth, $r > 0$ and for exponential decay, $r < 0$. No change when $r = 0$\n",
    "* For the form, $f(t) = a * b^t$, b represents (1 + r) and r must be greater than 0 for exponential growth. Therefore, for exponential growth, $b > 1$ and for exponential decay,  $b < 1$. If $b = 1$, no change.\n",
    " * The base of the exponent will be a fraction or decimal.\n",
    "* For the continuous form of growth, $f(t) = a * e^{rt}$, when $r < 0$ it's exponential decay.\n",

    " * The initial value, 'a', describes the y-intercept, i.e. when x is 0, y is the initial value.\n",
    " * The growth factor, 'b', will be greater than 1 for an increasing graph (growth), a fraction or decimal for a decreasing graph (decay), or will be equal to 1 for a horizontal line.\n",
    "   * For exponential decay, the graph will be mirrored across the y-axis.\n",

    "* Defined as all points in a plane where the difference of their distances from two fixed points is constant. \n",
    " * Each of the fixed points is called a **focus** of the hyperbola.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equations of Hyperbolas\n",
    "* The equation of a hyperbola looks the same as the equation of an ellipse, except it is a difference rather than a sum. \n",
    " * While the equations of an ellipse and a hyperbola are very similar, their graphs are very different.\n",
