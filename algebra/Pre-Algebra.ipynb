    "# Types of Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addition\n",
    "* Process of combining two or more numbers. The outcome is called the **sum**.\n",
    "* Expressed using the plus operator, +\n",
    "* Long Division:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subtraction\n",
    "* Process of reducing a number by another number. The outcome is called the **difference**.\n",
    "* Expressed using the minus operator, -\n",
    "* Long Subtraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplication\n",
    "* Signifies repeated addition. If a number has to be repeatedly added then that number is **multiplicand**. The number of multiplicands considered for addition is **multiplier**. The sum of the repetition is the **product**.\n",
    "* Expressed using the x or star symbols, x or *. In algebra, multiplication is also expressed using parenthesis or coefficients (See Expressions section below).\n",
    "* Long Multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Division\n",
    "* The reversal of multiplication. How often a given number called the **divisor** is contained in another given number called **dividend**. The outcome is called the **quotient** and the excess not divided evenly is called the **remainder**.\n",
    "* Expressed using the $\\div$ symbol or long division symbol, $\\overline{) number}$\n",
    "* Long Division:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponentiation\n",
    "* Signifies repeated multiplication of a number upon itself. The number to be repeatedly multiplied is called the **base** and the amount of times it's to be multiplied with itself is called the **exponent** or **power** or **degree**. \n",
    "* Written either by separating the base and exponent with a carat, b^n, or with the power as a superscript, $b^n$ where b is the base and n is the exponent/power. Pronounced as \"b to the power of n\".\n",
    "* **Perfect Square** is any whole number taken to the power of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplifying Exponents\n",
    "* Generally, if the exponent $\\leq 3$, apply the exponent. If the exponent $\\geq3$, leave the answer in exponential form.\n",
    "* All numbers have an implied exponent of 1, thus any number raised to the power of 1 is the same number.\n",
    " * Example: $5^1 = 5$\n",
    "* Any number with an exponent of 0 results in 1.\n",
    " * Example: $5^0 = 1$\n",
    "* For negative numbers with exponents that aren't wrapped in parenthesis, the sign of the result will be negative.\n",
    " * Example: $-3^4 = -(3 * 3 * 3 * 3) = -81$\n",
    "* For negative numbers with exponenets wrapped in parenthesis, the sign of the result is positive if the exponent is even and negative if the exponent is odd.\n",
    " * Example: $(-3)^4 = (-3)(-3)(-3)(-3) = 81$\n",
    " * Example: $(-3)^3 = (-3)(-3)(-3) = -27$\n",
    "* **Product Property of Exponents**: When multiplying exponents where the bases are the same, add the exponents. I.e. If a is a real number and m,n are counting numbers, then $a^m * a^n = a^{m+n}$\n",
    " * Example: $2^2 * 2^3 = 2^{2+3} = 2^5$\n",
    "* **Power Property of Exponents**: When raising a power to a power, multiply the exponents. I.e If a is a real number and m,n are whole numbers, then $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$\n",
    " * Example: $(3^4)^2 = 3^{4 * 2} = 3^8$\n",
    "* **Product to a Power Property**: When multiplying exponents where the bases are different, apply the exponent to both bases. I.e. If a and b are real numbers and m is a whole number, then $(ab)^m = a^m b^m$\n",
    " * Example: $(2 * 3)^2 = 2^2 3^2 = 36$\n",
    "* **Quotient Property of Exponents**: When dividing exponents where the bases are the same, if the denominator exponent is smaller, subtract it from the numerator. If the numerator exponent is smaller, subtract it from the denominator & put the result over 1. I.e. If a is a real number, a$\\ne$0, and m,n are whole numbers, then if m > n $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, else if m < n $\\frac{1}{a^{n-m}}$\n",
    " * Example: $\\frac{2^5}{2^3} = 2^{5-3} = 2^2$\n",
    " * Example: $\\frac{2^3}{2^5} = \\frac{1}{2^{5-3}} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$\n",
    "* **Negative Exponents**: Represents the case of Quotient Property of Exponents where the numerator exponent is smaller than the denominator. Instead of subtracting the numerator & putting the altered result over 1, we subtract top to bottom as we would otherwise & use a negative exponent. An expression with negative exponents is not considered to be in its simplest form. Use the negative exponent property to put in simplest form. I.e. If n is a positive integer and a$\\ne$0, then $\\frac{1}{a^n} = a^{-n}$\n",
    " * Example: $4^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4^2}$\n",
    " * Example: $\\frac{1}{3^{-2}} = 3^2 = 9$\n",
    "* **Quotient to a Power Property**: For wrapped fractions with an exponent, apply the exponent to both the numerator & denominator. I.e. If a and b are real numbers, b$\\ne$0, and m is a counting number, then $(\\frac{a}{b})^m = \\frac{a^m}{b^m}$\n",
    " * Example: $(\\frac{7}{8})^2 = \\frac{7^2}{8^2} = \\frac{49}{64}$\n",
    "* **Quotient to a Negative Power Property**: For wrapped fractions with a negative exponent, take the reciprocal of the base and change the exponent to positive. The result is the same if we use the Quotient to a Power Property with Negative Exponents Property. I.e. If a, b are real numbers and a$\\neq$0, b$\\neq$0, and n is an integer, then $(\\frac{a}{b})^{-n} = (\\frac{b}{a})^n$\n",
    " * Example: $(\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{3}{4})^2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{9}{16}} = \\frac{16}{9}$\n",
    "   * $\\frac{16}{9} = (\\frac{4}{3})^2$, which is our property result before applying the Quotient to a Power Property.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Scientific Notation\n",
    "* A convenient, shorthand way of writing very large or very small numbers to make calculation easier, often in science.\n",
    "* A number is written in scientific notation when a number between 0 and 10 (1-9) is multiplied by a power of 10. \n",
    " * Customary to use the multiplication sign, despite that it's not generally used in algebra.\n",
    " * If the original number is:\n",
    "   * \\> 1, the power will be $10^n$ (positive)\n",
    "   * < 1, the power will be $10^{-n}$ (negative)\n",
    "* To **convert large numbers**, move the decimal to the left until it's a number between 0-10, exclusive, & multiply that number by 10 to the power of the amount of times the decimal was moved.\n",
    " * Example: $650,000,000 = 6.5 * 10^8$\n",
    "* To **convert very small decimal numbers**, move the decimal to the right until it's a number between 0-10, exclusive, & multiply that number by 10 to the negative power of the amount of times the decimal was moved. \n",
    " * Small # Example: $0.004 = 4 * 10^{-3}$\n",
    "* To **multiply & divide expressions**, use the Properties of Exponents.\n",
    " * Example multiplication: $(4 * 10^5)(2 * 10^{-7}) = (4 * 2)(10^{5+(-7)}) = 8 * 10^{-2} = 0.08$\n",
    " * Example division: $\\frac{9 * 10^3}{3 * 10^{-2}} = (\\frac{9}{3})(10^{3-(-2)}) = 3 * 10^5 = 300,000$\n",
    " \n",
    "## Roots\n",
    "* The reversal of exponentiation. Represents a number called the **root** that when multiplied by itself a given number of times, called the **degree** or **index**, will equal another given number, called the **radicand**. \n",
    "* Written using a radical symbol, $\\sqrt[n]{x}$, where n is the degree and x is the radicand. Pronounced as \"nth root of x\".\n",
    "* **Square Root** is a number multiplied by itself only once to get a square are used most commonly such that the radical symbol without a specified degree is implied to be a square root operation, $\\sqrt{x}$. Pronounced as \"square root of x\" rather than \"2nd root of x\". See below for more detail.\n",
    "* **Cube Root** is a number multiplied by itself twice. Written as $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and pronounced as \"cube root of x\" rather than \"third root of x\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Square Roots \n",
    "* **Square Root Property**: Every positive number has two square roots, a positive one and a negative one. I.e. If $x^2 = k$, then $x=\\sqrt{k}$ or $x = -\\sqrt{k}$ or $x = \\pm\\sqrt{k}$. This is because even when the root is negative, multiplying a negative number by a negative numer equals a positive, , e.g. $5^2 = 25$ and $(-5)^2 = 25$.\n",
    " * The positive square root, aka the **pricipal square root** is represented with the radical symbol, $\\sqrt{x}$, e.g. $\\sqrt{25} = 25$\n",
    " * The negative square root is represented by placing a minus symbol in front of  the radical sign, $-\\sqrt{x}$, e.g. $-\\sqrt{25} = -5$.\n",
    "* Any negative numbers have no square roots that are real numbers for the same reason positives have 2 square roots: positive multiples result in positve and negative multiples result in positive. Thus $\\sqrt{-x} \\neq\\mathbb{R}$ (see Types of Numbers in section below).\n",
    "* Zero has only one square root, which is 0, i.e. $\\sqrt{0} = 0$ because $0^2 = 0$.\n",
    "* **Perfect Squares** are numbers with whole number roots.\n",
    " * Example: The root of $\\sqrt{9}$ is 3, which is a whole number.\n",
    "* **Irrational Numbers**: Square roots that aren't perfect squares. If the radicand is not prime, it can still be simiplified as illustrated in the 'Simplifying Roots' section below. If the radicand is prime, can either use relationship symbols to represent an approximation of value, or, using a calculator, the answer will be an approximate decimal and will require the approximation symbol (rather than the equals sign) and usually round to the nearest hundrenth decimal.\n",
    " * Example: $2 < \\sqrt{5} < 3$ \n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplifying Roots\n",
    "* Note: contains limited info, see Algebra-2 notebook for more.\n",
    "* Any root of 1 is always 1.\n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt[4]{1} = 1$\n",
    "* Any root of 0 is always 0.\n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt[4]{0} = 0$\n",
    "* A square root is considered simplified if its radicand contains no perfect square factors.\n",
    " * Ex: $\\sqrt{32}$ is not simplified because one of 32's factors, 16, is a perfect square factor ($4^2$).\n",
    "* **Product Property of Radicals**: If two radicals have the same index number, you can multiply them under the same radical sign. I.e. if a, b are non-negative real numbers, then $\\sqrt[n]{xy} = \\sqrt[n]{x} * \\sqrt[n]{y}$\n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt[3]{3} * \\sqrt[3]{2} = \\sqrt[3]{2 * 3} = \\sqrt[3]{6}$\n",
    " * We can use this property in reverse to find & reduce any perfect squares. Prime factor the number & keep them all under the radical symbol. If the radical is a sqare root, you're looking for pairs of the same number; if it's a cube root, you're looking for 3, and so on. The bases of the pairs go on the outside of the radical (as a prefix) and will be multiplied with each other. Anything not able to be squared stays under the radical to be multiplied back. When taking the root of negative radicands (odd roots only), put negative on outside.\n",
    "   * Example: $\\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 * 2} = \\sqrt{25} * \\sqrt{2} = 5\\sqrt{2}$\n",
    "   * Example: $\\sqrt{432} = \\sqrt{(2 * 2) * (2 * 2) * (3 * 3) * 3} = 2 * 2 * 3\\sqrt{3} = 12\\sqrt{3}$\n",
    "   * Example: $\\sqrt[3]{-32} = \\sqrt[3]{-(2 * 2 * 2) * 2 * 2} = -2\\sqrt[3]{2 * 2} =  -2\\sqrt[3]{4}$\n",
    "* **Quotient Property of Radicals**: If the index, n, is even, x and y represent any **nonnegative** real number and y does not equal 0. If the index, n, is odd, x and y represent any real number and y does not equal 0. I.e. $\\sqrt[n]{\\frac{x}{y}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[n]{x}}{\\sqrt[n]{y}}$ (The indices must be the same).\n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{5}$\n",
    " * Example: $\\frac{\\sqrt{50}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{5}} = \\sqrt{10}$\n",
    "* **Fractional Exponents**: aka Rational Exponents, converts to radicals where the index is the fraction's denominator and the numerator is an addiontal exponent. See Rational Exponents section in Algebra-2 for more.\n",
    " * Example: $4^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{4^2} = \\sqrt[3]{16} = \\sqrt[3]{2 * 2 * 2 * 2} = 2\\sqrt[3]{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real World Examples\n",
    "* Area & Side Length of Squares: Since the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of any of its sides, likewise the length of a square's side(s) can be calculated by taking the square root of its area, $\\sqrt{A}$\n",
    " * Example: If the Area of a square = 9, then the length of its sides is $\\sqrt{9} = 3$\n",
    "* Gravity: On Earth, if an object is dropped from a height of h feet, the time in seconds it will take to reach the ground is found by evaluating the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{4}$\n",
    " * Example: If an object is dropped from a height of 64 feet, the amount of seconds for it to reach the ground is $\\frac{\\sqrt{64}}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$ seconds.\n",
    "* Car Accident Investigation: Using square root formula with skid mark distance can determine the speed the car was going before applying the brakes. According to some formulas, if the length of the skid marks is d feet, then the speed of the car, in mph, can be found by evaluating $\\sqrt{24d}$\n",
    " * Example: If skid marks were 190 ft, the speed of the car (in mph) before braking is $\\sqrt{24(190)} = \\sqrt{4560} = 67.527772...$. The rounded speed is 67.5 mph\n",

    "* **Whole Numbers** ($\\mathbb{W}$): is the set of  natural numbers, plus zero, i.e. {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …}.\n",
    "* **Integers** ($\\mathbb{Z}$): set of all whole numbers plus all the negatives (or opposites) of the natural numbers, i.e. {… , ⁻2, ⁻1, 0, 1, 2, …}\n",
    "* **Rational Numbers** ($\\mathbb{Q}$): any number that can be represented as a fraction, where the top and bottom numbers are integers & the denominator is not 0, e.g. 1/2, 3/4, 7/2, ⁻4/3, 4/1 \n",
    " * This includes all integers since they can be represented as a fraction with a denominator of 1 in the case of non-zero numbers, and a fraction with the numerator of 0 in the case of 0.\n",
    " * This also includes decimals that end or have repeating digits.\n",
    " * But does not include decimals with infinite non-repeating digits.\n",
    " * Notice that \"ratio\" is in the name.\n",
    "* **Irrational Numbers**: numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction, e.g. $\\pi$, $\\sqrt2$, $\\sqrt{3}$, n\n",
    "* **Real Numbers** ($\\mathbb{R}$): (also called measuring numbers or measurement numbers). Includes all rational, & irrational numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.\n",

    "# Integers\n",
    "* Type of rational number, comprising of all whole numbers (which include natural numbers) as well as the negatives of the natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Integers\n",
    "* **Even Numbers**: Numbers that are multiples of 2.\n",
    "* **Odd Numbers** numbers: Numbers which are not multiples of 2 & leave 1 as the remainder when divided by 2.\n",
    "* **Prime Numbers**: Any number other than 1 which does not have any factor apart from one and the number itself is called a prime number.\n",
    " * **Co-prime/Relatively Prime Numbers**: Two numbers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if they do not have any common factor other than one.\n",
    "* **Composite Numbers**: a number that has more than two distinct factors.\n",
    "* **Perfect Numbers** are equal to the sum of their “proper” divisors (positive integers that divide a number evenly, not counting itself). For example, 6 = 3 + 2 + 1, and 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept: Multiples & Factors\n",
    "* A **factor** of a number is the number that divides it completely without leaving any remainder.\n",
    " * Two numbers that we multiply together to get a certain product are called **factor pairs**. \n",
    "* A **multiple** of a number is the product of the number and a counting number\n",

    "* 5: last digit is either 0 or 5\n",
    "* 6: is divisible by both 2 and 3\n",
    "* 10: the last digit is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factorization\n",
    "* Determining all the factors of a number\n",
    "* We can find all the factors of any counting number by systematically dividing the number by each counting number, starting with 1. If the quotient is also a counting number (whole number), then the divisor and the quotient are factors of the number. We can stop when the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor because the factors will start to duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining Primality\n",
    "* Determining if a number is a prime number.\n",
    "* Whole Numbers are either prime or composite, with the exception of 1, which is neither. All composite numbers have prime factors. So, if a number has a prime factor, it's not a prime & is instead a composite.\n",
    "* For quick determination of some numbers, we can use patterns of multiples for 2, 3, & 5. \n",
    " * Even numbers (except 2) are composite.\n",
    " * If the sum of the number's digits is a multiple of 3, it's composite.\n",
    " * If the number ends in 5 or 0, it's composite.\n",
    "* For complete determination, we use the same process used in factorization except divide the number by prime numbers until the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor. If no primes divide evenly, the number is prime.\n",

    "#### Prime Factorization\n",
    "* every composite number can be written as a unique product of primes\n",
    "* can either be written by specifying each prime separated by a mulitplication sign or in exponential form.\n",
    "* find prime factorization of a number using the ladder method\n",
    " * To begin building the “ladder,” divide the given number by its smallest prime factor. To add a “step” to the ladder, we continue dividing by the same prime until it no longer divides evenly. Then we divide by the next prime. Continue dividing up the ladder in this way until the quotient is prime.\n",
    " * Example: Find Prime Factorization of 36\n",
    "   * 36/2=18, 18/2=9, 9/3= 3\n",
    "   * Take all the divisors & the last quotient: 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = $2^2 * 3^2$\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Least Common Multiple (LCM)\n",
    "* A common multiple of two numbers is a number that is a multiple of both numbers. The LCM is the smallest of the common multiples of those numbers.\n",
    "* Useful when adding/subtracting fractions with different denominators.\n",
    "* Find the LCM in smaller numbers by seeing if the smaller number is a divisor of the larger. If so, the larger number is the LCM. If not, multiply the larger number by 2 and check again.\n",
    "* Find the LCM in small or large numbers by using the Prime Factor Method. To do this, find the Prime Factorization of both numbers. If there are repeating factors between numbers, we're only using each factor once. That is, use repeated factors from the same number, but don't take those factors again from the second number (can use columns to determine this). Then multiply those factors together. The product is the LCM.\n",
    " * Exmaple: Find the LCM of 12 and 18\n",
    "   * 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 ....\n",
    "   * 18 = 2 * .... 3 * 3\n",
    "   * Since both numbers have both 2's & 3's, we're only taking the largest amount for each. 12 has two 2's whereas 18 only has 1, so we keep 2 * 2. Likewise, 18 has two 3's whereas 12 only has one 3. so we keep 3 * 3. You can also think of these as columns where if you dropped down the numbers from each column, you'd get:\n",
    "   * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Greatest Common Factor (GCF)\n",

    "## Concept: Negative Integers\n",
    "* Integers, unlike whole numbers (which are natural numbers and 0), can be negative. Another name for the set of natural numbers is positive integers.\n",
    "* A negative number is a number less than 0.\n",
    "* Operations on negative integers have a different set of rules that affects their sign.\n",
    "* If the negative number comes after the operator sign, it's surrounded in parenthesis.\n",
    "* If the number(s) are surrounded in parenthesis with no operator sign, the operator is multiplication.\n",

    " * Example: 5 + (-2) = 3\n",
    "* 2 negative sum a negative\n",
    " * Example: -5 + (-2) = -7\n",
    "* When summing a positive & negative, if there is more negatives, sum is negative whereas more positives, the sum is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subtraction of Negative Integers\n",
    "* If the second number is a negative, the operator becomes addition (2 negatives = a positive)\n",
    " * Example: 5 - (-2) = 7\n",
    " * Exmaple: -5 - (-2) = -3\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Division & Multiplication of Negative Integers\n",
    "* In algebra, multiplication is usually represented using parenthesis.\n",
    "* Multiplying/Dividing 2 negatives, the product/quotient is positive.\n",
    " * Example: -2(-4) = 8\n",
    "* Multiplying/Dividing 1 negative & 1 positive, the product/quotient is negative.\n",

    "## Concept: Absolute Value\n",
    "* A negative number is a mirror image of its positive with 0 in the middle, each called the **opposite** of the other. On a number line, they are the same distance from zero in the opposite direction of each other. -a is the opposite of a.\n",
    "* The distance between 0 and any number of the number line is called the **absolute value** and is represented with surrounding bar symbols, |a|, where $|a| \\ge 0$ for all numbers. \n",
    "* Absolute value is never negative because distance cannot be negative. The only number with an absolute value of 0 is 0 itself.\n",
    " * Example: -5 is 5 units from 0, so |-5| = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expressions with Absolute Value\n",
    "* The absolute value symbols are grouping symbols so they're evaluated as such, being first in the order of operations. But since they're never negative, they're evaluated differently than other grouping symbols.\n",
    " * Example: $-|-9| = -9$\n",
    " * Example: $-(-9) \\ne -9$\n",
    "* Since Order of Operations starts with inner grouping symbols first, we evaluate those first moving outward.\n",

    "# Inequalities\n",
    "* Equations where the result is any number larger/smaller than specific value, or bound.\n",
    "* Instead of an equals sign, inequalities are equations with a less than(<), greater than(>), greater than or equal to($\\ge$), or less than or equal to($\\le$) relationship symbols.\n",
    " * Example: x > 4 means the solution, x, is greater than 4.\n",
    "* Inequalities that specify a range with upper and lower bounds are called **double inequalities** and utilize multiple relationship symbols.\n",
    " * Example: 5 < x <= 10 means the solution is in a range greater than 5 but less than 11.\n",
    "   * 5 is excluded but 10 is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval Notation\n",
    "* Inequalities can also be represented using interval notation, where the upper and lower bounds are separated by a comma and wrapped in parenthesis, brackets, or a mixture of both to specify bound inclusion/exclusion.\n",
    "* Parens, ( ), represent exclusion and square brackets, \\[ \\], represent inclusion on the side of the bound. Essentially, parens are equivalent to the 'less than' & 'greater than' symbols, while square brackets are equivalent to the 'less than or equal to' & 'greater than or equal to' symbols.\n",
    " * Example: Using interval notation with the example above, \\[5, 10) means the solution is between 5, exclusive, and 10, inclusive. \\]\n",
    "* For basic inequalities either without an upper or lower bound, an **infinity** symbol, $\\infty$, is used next to a parenthesis. The existing bound may have a paren or bracket, but the infinity will always be next to parenthesis. If the solution is 'less' or 'less equal to', a negative infinity, $-\\infty$, is used. I.e. negative infinities will always be on the left side and positives will always be on the right.\n",
    " * Example: x => 3 is written as $[3, \\infty)$\n",
    " * Example: x < 5 is written as $(-\\infty, 5)$\n",
    "* Inequalities with only constants and no variables are represented only with infinity symbols since the solution is all real numbers.\n",

    "## Evaluating Inequalities\n",
    "* Similar to the General Method for Equalities except the relationship inequality sign flips when:\n",
    " * 1. Dividing/multiplying by a negative number.\n",
    " * 2. Sides are swaped.\n",
    "* Double inequalities are solved by applying the same principles to all 3 sides of the equation.\n",
    "* Note: Like equalities, it's easiest to collect the variables on the side where the coefficient of the variable is largest. This eliminates negative coefficients and so we don’t have to multiply or divide by a negative—which means we don’t have to remember to reverse the inequality sign.\n",
    "* Clearing Inequalities is also the same as clearing equalities, with the same exceptions for flipping the signs.\n",

    "## Classifying Inequalities\n",
    "* Unlike regular equations, inequalities can only be true (identity) or false (contradiction).\n",
    "* There is no conditional because inequalities already represent a range. \n",
    "* After evaluating, if the result is a true statement, we have an **identity**, represented in interval notation with double infinities, $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, since the solution has no variables and thus is all real numbers.\n",
    " * Example: 8x−2(5−x) < 4(x+9)+6x\n",
    "   * Simplify: 10x−10 < 10x+36\n",

    "## Compound Inequalities\n",
    "* Made up of two inequalities connected by the word **“and” or the word “or”**.\n",
    " * Ex: x+3 > −4 and 4x−5 ≤ 3\n",
    "* To solve a compound inequality means to find all values of the variable that make the compound inequality a true statement. Solve each inequality separately and then consider the two solutions based on the \"and\" or the \"or\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intersection of Inequalities (And)\n",
    "* To solve a compound inequality with the word “and”, we look for all numbers that make **both** inequalities true, known as the **intersection of the two inequalities**, i.e. the range where the solutions overlap.\n",
    "* Compound Inequalities that are intersections are the same as **double inequalities** written more concisely. \"a < x and x < b\" can be written simply as \"a < x < b\". The two forms are equivalent. \n",
    " * Be cognizant of flipping the signs when swapping the sides to format.\n",
    "* When translated to interval notation, if symbols of the compound format are opposites, the variable is in the middle of the double format & there will be two numerical bounds in the interval notation. Otherwise, one side will have an infinity symbol and the bound will be the one included in both inequalities since we're looking for the overlap. \n",
    "* Example: Solve 6x−3 < 9 and 2x+9 ≥ 3.\n",
    " * Evaluate 1st inequality: $x < 2$\n",
    " * Evaluate 2nd inequality: $x \\ge -3$\n",

    " * Evaluate 1st: $x \\le \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    " * Evaluate 2nd: $x < 4$\n",
    " * Double format: $x \\le \\frac{1}{2} < 4$\n",
    " * Interval notation: $(-\\infty, \\frac{1}{2}]$ (the bound is not 4 because that range doesn't exist in both.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Union of Inequalities (Or)\n",
    "* To solve a compound inequality with the word “or,” we look for all numbers that make **either** inequality true, known as the **union of the two inequalities**, i.e. all of the possible solutions.\n",
    "* To write the solution in interval notation, we will often use the union symbol, $\\cup$, to show the union of the solutions if there is a gap in the range.\n",
    "* Example: Solve 5−3x ≤ −1 or 8+2x ≤ 5\n",
    " * Evaluate 1st inequality: $x \\ge 2$ (don't forget to flip the sign)\n",
    " * Evaluate 2nd inequality: $x \\le -\\frac{3}{2}$\n",

    "## Absolute Value Inequalities\n",
    "* Since the absolute value is the distance from 0 in either direction on a number line, an inequality represents any value either between a number to its opposite or outside a number and its opposite.\n",
    "* Due to this logic, you cannot represent absolute value in an inequality by simply rewriting 2 equations with the same relationship symbol like with equalities and equals sign.\n",
    "* This creates compound inequalities based on their \"less and less equal\" or their \"greater or greater equal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Less Than Absolute Value\n",
    "* Less or less equal represents any distance that is less/less-equal than a given number. Since it's an absolute value, the distance is applied to zero in both directions. The value will be between the given number and its opposite, which represents a compound inequality of an intersection of values.\n",
    "* For any algebraic expresion, u, and any positive real number a, if $|u| < a$, then $-a < u < a$.\n",
    " * Same applies for \"less or equal to\".\n",
    "* Example: $|x| \\le 5$\n",
    " * Any number between 0-5 is applied to the number line in both directions from zero: -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5\n",
    " * Rewrite in doule format: $-5 \\le x \\le 5$\n",
    "   * Note- Compound Inequality using \"And\": $x \\le 5$ and $x \\ge -5$\n",
    " * Interval notation: $[-5, 5]$\n",
    "* To solve with expressions, rewrite less than absolute values in double format using it's proptery. Solve double format equation by applying changes to all sides of equation. Convert to interval notation.\n",
    "* Example: $|5x-6| \\le 4$\n",
    " * Rewrite: $-4 \\le 5x-6 \\le 4$\n",
    " * Evaluate: $2 \\le 5x \\le 10$\n",
    " * Solve: $\\frac{2}{5} \\le x \\le 2$\n",
    " * Interval notation: $[\\frac{2}{5}, 2]$\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Greater Than Absolute Value\n",
    "* Greater or greater equal represents any value outside of the distance between the number opposites. The result is a compound inequality representing a union (\"or\").\n",
    "* For any algebraic expression, u, and any positive real number, a, if $|u| > a$ then $u < -a$ or $u > a$.\n",
    " * Same for \"greater or equal to\".\n",
    "* Example: $|x| \\ge 5$\n",
    " * All numbers greater or equal to 5 are applied to the number line in both directions: 6 and above, -6 and below.\n",
    " * Rewrite in union format: $x \\le -5$ or $x \\ge 5$\n",
    " * Interval notation: $(-\\infty, -5] \\cup [5, \\infty)$ \n",
    "* To solve with expressions,rewrite in coupound union format, solve both equations, translate to interval notation.\n",
    "* Example: $|2x-3| \\ge 5$\n",
    " * Rewrite: $2x-3 \\le -5$ OR $2x-3 \\ge 5$\n",
    " * Evaluate E1: $x \\le -1$\n",
