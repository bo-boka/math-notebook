    "* Long Division:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponentiation\n",
    "* Signifies repeated multiplication of a number upon itself. The number to be repeatedly multiplied is called the **base** and the amount of times it's to be multiplied with itself is called the **exponent** or the **power**. \n",
    "* Written either by separating the base and exponent with a carat, b^n, or with the power as a superscript, $b^n$ where b is the base and n is the exponent/power. Pronounced as \"b to the power of n\".\n",
    "* **Perfect Square** is any whole number taken to the power of 2.\n",

    "#### Simplifying Exponents\n",
    "* Generally, if the exponent $\\leq 3$, apply the exponent. If the exponent $\\geq3$, leave the answer in exponential form.\n",
    "* Any number with an exponent of 0 results in 1.\n",
    " * Example: $5^0 = 1$\n",
    "* For negative numbers with exponents that aren't wrapped in parenthesis, the sign of the result will be negative.\n",
    " * Example: $-3^4 = -(3 * 3 * 3 * 3) = -81$\n",
    "* For negative numbers with exponenets wrapped in parenthesis, the sign of the result is positive if the exponent is even and negative if the exponent is odd.\n",

    "* **Quotient Property of Exponents**: When dividing exponents where the bases are the same, if the denominator exponent is smaller, subtract it from the numerator. If the numerator exponent is smaller, subtract it from the denominator & put the result over 1. I.e. If a is a real number, a$\\ne$0, and m,n are whole numbers, then if m > n $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, else if m < n $\\frac{1}{a^{n-m}}$\n",

    " * Example: $\\frac{2^3}{2^5} = \\frac{1}{2^{5-3}} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$\n",
    "* **Negative Exponents**: Represents the case of Quotient Property of Exponents where the numerator exponent is smaller than the denominator. Instead of putting the altered result over 1, we use a negative exponent, although that's not its simplest form. I.e. If n is a positive integer and a$\\ne$0, then $\\frac{1}{a^n} = a^{-n}$\n",

    "   * < 1, the power will be $10^{-n}$ (negative)\n",
    "* To **convert large numbers**, move the decimal to the left until it's a number between 0-10, exclusive, & multiply that number by 10 to the power of the amount of times the decimal was moved.\n",

    "* **Square Root** is a number multiplied by itself only once to get a square are used most commonly such that the radical symbol without a specified degree is implied to be a square root operation, $\\sqrt{x}$. Pronounced as \"square root of x\" rather than \"2nd root of x\". See below for more detail.\n",
    "* **Cube Root** is a number multiplied by itself twice. Written as $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and pronounced as \"cube root of x\" rather than \"third root of x\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Square Roots\n",
    "* aka 'positive square root' or 'principal square root'. \n",
    "* Every positive number has two square roots, a positive one and a negative one. \n",
    " * The 'Positive Square Root', aka the 'Pricipal Square Root' is represented with the radical symbol, $\\sqrt{x}$. \n",
    " * The negative square root is represented by placing a minus symbol in front of  the radical sign, $-\\sqrt{x}$\n",
    "* Cannot take a square root of a negative number because two positives multiplies are positive while two negatives multiplied also equal a positive. Rather, there is no \"Real Number\" solution (See Types of Numbers below).\n",
    "* For square roots that aren't perfect squares, we can either use relationship symbols to represent an approximation of value, or, if we use a calculator, the answer will be an approximate decimal and will require the approximation symbol (rather than the equals sign) and usually round to the nearest hundrenth decimal.\n",
    " * Example: $2 < \\sqrt{5} < 3$ \n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24$\n",
    "* Area & Side Length of Squares: Since the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of any of its sides, likewise the length of a square's side(s) can be calculated by taking the square root of its area, $\\sqrt{A}$\n",
    " * Example: If the Area of a square = 9, then the length of its sides is $\\sqrt{9} = 3$\n",
    "* Gravity: On Earth, if an object is dropped from a height of h feet, the time in seconds it will take to reach the ground is found by evaluating the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{4}$\n",
    " * Example: If an object is dropped from a height of 64 feet, the amount of seconds for it to reach the ground is $\\frac{\\sqrt{64}}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$ seconds.\n",
    "* Car Accident Investigation: Using square root formula with skid mark distance can determine the speed the car was going before applying the brakes. According to some formulas, if the length of the skid marks is d feet, then the speed of the car, in mph, can be found by evaluating $\\sqrt{24d}$\n",
    " * Example: If skid marks were 190 ft, the speed of the car (in mph) before braking is $\\sqrt{24(190)} = \\sqrt{4560} = 67.527772...$. The rounded speed is 67.5 mph\n"

    "* **Integers** (Z): set of all whole numbers plus all the negatives (or opposites) of the natural numbers, i.e. {… , ⁻2, ⁻1, 0, 1, 2, …}\n",
    "* **Rational Numbers** (Q): any number that can be represented as a fraction, where the top and bottom numbers are integers & the denominator is not 0, e.g. 1/2, 3/4, 7/2, ⁻4/3, 4/1 \n",
    " * This includes all integers since they can be represented as a fraction with a denominator of 1 in the case of non-zero numbers, and a fraction with the numerator of 0 in the case of 0.\n",
    " * This also includes decimals that end or have repeating digits.\n",
    " * But does not include decimals with infinite non-repeating digits.\n",
    " * Notice that \"ratio\" is in the name.\n",
    "* **Irrational Numbers**: numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction, e.g. $\\pi$, $\\sqrt2$, $\\sqrt{3}$, n\n",
    "* **Real Numbers** (R): (also called measuring numbers or measurement numbers). Includes all rational, & irrational numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.\n",
    "* **Complex Numbers** (C): numbers which have both real and imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete vs Continuous Numbers\n",
    "The above types of number sets can be split up into discrete or continuous numbers.\n",
    "* N, W, Z and Q are referred to as discrete. This means that they are separate and distinct entities & each of these sets is countable.\n",
    "* The last set, R, cannot be counted. This is because they are continuous. Between any two real numbers, however close they may be, there are infinitely more real numbers.\n",

    "# Integers\n",
    "* Type of rational number, comprising of all whole numbers (which include natural numbers) as well as the negatives of the natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Integers\n",
    "* **Even Numbers**: Numbers that are multiples of 2.\n",
    "* **Odd Numbers** numbers: Numbers which are not multiples of 2 & leave 1 as the remainder when divided by 2.\n",
    "* **Prime Numbers**: Any number other than 1 which does not have any factor apart from one and the number itself is called a prime number.\n",
    " * **Co-prime/Relatively Prime Numbers**: Two numbers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if they do not have any common factor other than one.\n",
    "* **Composite Numbers**: a number that has more than two distinct factors.\n",
    "* **Perfect Numbers** are equal to the sum of their “proper” divisors (positive integers that divide a number evenly, not counting itself). For example, 6 = 3 + 2 + 1, and 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept: Multiples & Factors\n",
    "* A **factor** of a number is the number that divides it completely without leaving any remainder.\n",
    " * Two numbers that we multiply together to get a certain product are called **factor pairs**. \n",
    "* A **multiple** of a number is the product of the number and a counting number\n",
    "* Notice that the Types of Integers are relative to their factors & multiples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern of Multiples\n",
    "* 2: even numbers\n",
    "* 3: has a sum of digits that is multiple of 3\n",
    "* 5: last digit is either 0 or 5\n",
    "* 6: is divisible by both 2 and 3\n",
    "* 10: the last digit is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factorization\n",
    "* Determining all the factors of a number\n",
    "* We can find all the factors of any counting number by systematically dividing the number by each counting number, starting with 1. If the quotient is also a counting number (whole number), then the divisor and the quotient are factors of the number. We can stop when the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor because the factors will start to duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining Primality\n",
    "* Determining if a number is a prime number.\n",
    "* Whole Numbers are either prime or composite, with the exception of 1, which is neither. All composite numbers have prime factors. So, if a number has a prime factor, it's not a prime & is instead a composite.\n",
    "* For quick determination of some numbers, we can use patterns of multiples for 2, 3, & 5. \n",
    " * Even numbers (except 2) are composite.\n",
    " * If the sum of the number's digits is a multiple of 3, it's composite.\n",
    " * If the number ends in 5 or 0, it's composite.\n",
    "* For complete determination, we use the same process used in factorization except divide the number by prime numbers until the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor. If no primes divide evenly, the number is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prime Factorization\n",
    "* every composite number can be written as a unique product of primes\n",
    "* can either be written by specifying each prime separated by a mulitplication sign or in exponential form.\n",
    "* find prime factorization of a number using the ladder method\n",
    " * To begin building the “ladder,” divide the given number by its smallest prime factor. To add a “step” to the ladder, we continue dividing by the same prime until it no longer divides evenly. Then we divide by the next prime. Continue dividing up the ladder in this way until the quotient is prime.\n",
    " * Example: Find Prime Factorization of 36\n",
    "   * 36/2=18, 18/2=9, 9/3= 3\n",
    "   * Take all the divisors & the last quotient: 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = $2^2 * 3^2$\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Least Common Multiple (LCM)\n",
    "* A common multiple of two numbers is a number that is a multiple of both numbers. The LCM is the smallest of the common multiples of those numbers.\n",
    "* Useful when adding/subtracting fractions with different denominators.\n",
    "* Find the LCM in smaller numbers by seeing if the smaller number is a divisor of the larger. If so, the larger number is the LCM. If not, multiply the larger number by 2 and check again.\n",
    "* Find the LCM in small or large numbers by using the Prime Factor Method. To do this, find the Prime Factorization of both numbers. If there are repeating factors between numbers, we're only using each factor once. That is, use repeated factors from the same number, but don't take those factors again from the second number (can use columns to determine this). Then multiply those factors together. The product is the LCM.\n",
    " * Exmaple: Find the LCM of 12 and 18\n",
    "   * 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 ....\n",
    "   * 18 = 2 * .... 3 * 3\n",
    "   * Since both numbers have both 2's & 3's, we're only taking the largest amount for each. 12 has two 2's whereas 18 only has 1, so we keep 2 * 2. Likewise, 18 has two 3's whereas 12 only has one 3. so we keep 3 * 3. You can also think of these as columns where if you dropped down the numbers from each column, you'd get:\n",
    "   * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Greatest Common Factor (GCF)\n",
    "* Found similarly to finding the LCM, except after the columns are lined up, only keep the factors that occur in both sets.\n",
    " * Example: Use above for 12 and 18\n",
    "   * 2 and 3 are the duplicates.\n",
    "   * 2 * 3 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations on Negative Integers\n",
    "* Integers, unlike whole numbers (which are natural numbers and 0), can be negative. Another name for the set of natural numbers is positive integers.\n",
    "* Operations on negative integers have a different set of rules that affects their sign.\n",
    "* If the negative number comes after the operator sign, it's surrounded in parenthesis.\n",
    "* If the number(s) are surrounded in parenthesis with no operator sign, the operator is multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addition of Negative Integers\n",
    "* If the second number is a negative, the operator becomes subtraction\n",
    " * Example: 5 + (-2) = 3\n",
    "* 2 negative sum a negative\n",
    " * Example: -5 + (-2) = -7\n",
    "* When summing a positive & negative, if there is more negatives, sum is negative whereas more positives, the sum is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subtraction of Negative Integers\n",
    "* If the second number is a negative, the operator becomes addition (2 negatives = a positive)\n",
    " * Example: 5 - (-2) = 7\n",
    " * Exmaple: -5 - (-2) = -3\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Division & Multiplication of Negative Integers\n",
    "* In algebra, multiplication is usually represented using parenthesis.\n",
    "* Multiplying/Dividing 2 negatives, the product/quotient is positive.\n",
    " * Example: -2(-4) = 8\n",
    "* Multiplying/Dividing 1 negative & 1 positive, the product/quotient is negative.\n",
    " * Example: -2(4) = -8\n",

    "* Writing a number as a decimal is known as decimal notation.\n",
    " * Note that decimals are usually rounded to the thousandth, unless otherwise specified or when working with money, in which case round to the hundredth.\n",
    "* Since the right of the decimal represents values less than 1, the place values grow smaller as you move to the right ascending each place in powers of 10. Note the figure below:\n",

    "# Evaluating Algebraic Expressions\n",
    "* Evaluating algebraic expressions employs the use of logical rules that apply to all real numbers so as to simplify an expression.\n",
    "* We solve an expression using the Order of Operations & evaluate it by using substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Order of Operations\n",
    "* Order of Operations are the rules denoting the order in which terms in an expression are evaluated. BODMAS (or PEMDAS) is an acronym helpful for memorizing the order:\n",
    " 1. **B**rackets first: Evaluate terms within grouping symbols (incl fraction bar, abs val, radical)\n",
    "    1. For brackets within brackets, work inner to outer.\n",
    " 2. **O**rders (i.e. Exponents and Roots, etc.)\n",
    "    1. Exponents of Exponents are evaluated top down.\n",
    " 3. **D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (left-to-right)\n",
    " 4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left-to-right)\n",
    "* But for multiplication & addition, we can use the Commutative & Associative Properties to rearrange order or operations in a way that could reduce work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Substitution\n",
    "* Substitution is plugging in numbers where the letters are, if you have their values.\n",
    "* When substituting negative numbers, wrap negative numbers in parenthesis.\n",
    "* To reduce work, simplify the expression as much as possible before plugging in values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding/Subtracting Monomials\n",
    "* We can add or subtract monomials if they are like terms.\n",
    "* Terms are called **Like Terms** if they have the same variables and exponents. All constant terms are also like terms. Radicals must have the same index AND radicand. Else, they're **Unlike Terms**.\n",
    "* If a term has multiple variables or coefficients, the order of the variables/coefficients that aren't next to the exponent does not matter and they are still considered like terms, as per the Associative Property of Multiplication.\n",
    " * Example: 3a$^2$b + ba$^2$ = 4a$^2$b\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Combine Like Terms \n",
    "* Like terms can be added together or subtracted from one another simply by adding/subtracting the coefficients.\n",
    "* This is essentially using the Distributive Property in reverse (factoring), but without the added step.\n",
    " * Example: 5x + 3x = (5 + 3)x = 8x\n",
    "* A variable without a number coefficient still has an implied coefficient of 1.\n",
    "* If an expression has a lot of terms, it's best to rearrange the expression with like terms next to each other before combining. This rearrangement is per The Commutative Property of Addition, where terms can be rearranged without changing the values.\n",
    " * Example: 2x + 3 + a$^2$ + 4x - 1\n",
    "  * Rearrange: a$^2$ + 2x + 4x + 3 - 1\n",
    "  * Simplify: a$^2$ + 6x + 2\n",

    "* Multiply like base terms with coefficients by multiplying coefficients & raising variables to power of factors.\n",

    "* Multiply unlike base terms with coefficients by multiplying coefficients & leaving bases unchanged.\n",
    " * Example: 2a * 3b = 6ab\n",
    "* Can multiply terms with exponents if the variable is the same (exponents can be different) by multiplying the coefficients & adding the exponents. Note: More exponent examples in 'Exponents' section.\n",

    " * Example: $x^2 * x^3 = x^5$\n",
    "* Parenthesis can be further simplified by applying the exponent to each base, as per the 'Product to a Power Property'.\n",

    "   * $2x^2 = 2 * x * x$\n",
    "   * $(2x)^2 = 2x * 2x$ OR $2^2 x^2 = 4x^2$\n",

    " * Example: Raising to the zeroith power will always be 1.\n",
    "   * $(2x)^0 = 1$\n",
    "   * $(-7xy)^0 = 1$\n",

    "   * $(x^2)^6(x^5)^4 = x^{12}x^{20} = x^{32}$\n",
    " * Example: Simplify using Product to a Power Prop & further simplify using Power Prop.\n",
    "   * $(-7x^3y^4)^2 = (-7)^2(x^3)^2(y^4)^2 = 49x^6y^8$\n",
    "* Use Communtative Property to simplify long exponent results.\n",
    " * Example: Simplify & rearrange like terms to further simplify.\n",
    "   * $(6n)^2(4n^3) = 6^2 n^2 4n^3 = 36 * 4 * n^3 * n^2 = 144n^5$\n",

    " * Multiplication Example: $\\frac{12}{5}(-20x) = \\frac{12}{5}(-\\frac{20x}{1}) = -\\frac{240x}{5} = -48x$\n",
    "* Another strategey is \"clearing the equation of fractions\" whereby both sides of equation are multiplied by the LCD of all the fractions. Distribute existing parens first, if applicable.\n",
    " * Example: $\\frac{1}{8}x + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n",
    "   * Find LCD of all fractions: 8\n",
    "   * Multiply both sides: $\\frac{8}{1}(\\frac{1}{8}x + \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{8}{1}(\\frac{1}{4})$\n",
    "   * Evaluate: x + 4 = 2\n",

    "   * Solve: x = 15\n",
    "* Complex fractions that can be simplified in the numerator &/or denominator\n",

    "   * $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{13} = \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{1}{52}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dividing Exponents\n",
    "* When dividing exponents with the same base & the denominator exponent is smaller, subtract from numerator exponent. If numerator exponent is smaller, subtract from denominator exponent & put over 1, as per the 'Quotient Property of Exponenets'. Essentially, if numerator is larger, result is $\\frac{x}{1} = x$, else result is $\\frac{1}{x}$\n",
    " * Example: Numerator larger\n",

    "* When raising a fraction to a power, apply the exponent to both numerator & denominator as per the 'Quotient to a Power Property'. Reduce as much as possible inside parenthesis first to reduce unnecessary steps.\n",
    " * Example: Can't further reduce inside parens\n",

    "* Multiplying by another expression (binomial) in parenthesis.\n",
    "* **FOIL** (the acronym for first, outer, inner and last) method is an efficient way of remembering how to multiply two binomials in a very organized manner. In FOIL, \"First\" means to multiply the terms which occur in the first position of each binomial. \"Outer\" means to multiply the first term in the first binomial with the last term in the last binomial. Etc.\n",

    "## Slope\n",
    "* Visualy, slope is the steepness of a line.\n",
    "* Conceptually, slope is the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change between two points on the plane or a line. So, slope equals the ratio of the rise over the run, measuring the rate of change for a line.\n",
    "* **Rise**: Vertical change of a line (y-change).\n",
    "* **Run**: Horizontal change of a line (x-change).\n",
    "* **m**: Variable that's always used to represent slope.\n",
    "* Formula: $m = \\frac{rise}{run}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A line can slant upwards or downwards, but it is always read from left to right. Therefore, the rise can be positive or negative, but the run will always be positive. Thus, the rise determines the sign of a slope.\n",
    " * If a line slants upward, the slope is positive. \n",
    " * If a line slants downward, the slope is negative.\n",
    "* Slope is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the height & length of the sides are the rise & run, respectively. On a grid, if a line is vertical or horizontal, a right triangle cannot be formed because either the rise (height) or the run (length) is 0.\n",
    " * Horizontal lines have a slope of 0 because the rise is 0 and $\\frac{0}{x} = 0$ (0 divided by anything is 0).\n",
    " * Vertical lines have a slope of 'undefined' because the run is 0 and $\\frac{y}{0} = undefined$ (you can't divide by 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining Slope/Points/Lines Visually\n",
    "* The slope of a line on a grid can be determined by counting the rise & run from one point to the other.\n",
    " * Count the Rise: Start from the leftmost point and count the intervals vertically to the second point.\n",
    "  * If you count upward, the rise is positive.\n",
    "  * If you count downward, the ries is negative.\n",
    " * Count the Run: From the point you're at, count the intervals horizontally to the second point.\n",
    " * Put the rise over run in a fraction.\n",
    "* Likewise, a point on grid can be determined by counting in the same way using slope from another point. \n",
    " * For graphs with larger numbers, it's helpful to use a larger equivalent fraction of the slope for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slope Formula\n",
    "* If you have the coordinates of two points, you can get the slope by subtracting the first point from the second point to get the rate of change. \n",
    "* Formula: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\n",
    "* You will get the same answer regardless of which point is subtracted from which.\n",
    "* Example: Find the slope of (1, 2) and (3, 5)\n",
    " * $m = \\frac{5-2}{3-1}$\n",
    " * $m = \\frac{3}{2}$\n",
    "* The slope formula is the same as $m = \\frac{rise}{run}$ because rise represents a 'change in y' and run represents a 'change in x'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Points Given a Point & Slope\n",
    "* If you have the coordinates of 1 point and the slope of a line, you can calculate other points on the line to graph, since y is associated with the rise & x with the run.\n",
    "* Unofficial Formula: $(x_1,y_1) = (x + run, y + rise)$\n",
    "* To get the second point for a graph, you add the slope to the given point by adding the rise to y and the run to x. You can add the slope again to the result for a third point.\n",
    "* Example: For a point, (3, 2), and a slope of 2, find another point.\n",
    " * $(x_1,y_1) = (3 + 1, 2 + 2)$\n",
    " * $(x_1,y_1) = (4,4)$\n",
    " * $(x_2,y_2) = (4 + 1, 4 + 2)$\n",
    " * $(x_2,y_2) = (5,6)$\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Slope-Intercept Form\n",
    "* Used to easily determine slope & y-intercept.\n",
    "* The standard form of a linear equation in two variables is ax + by + c = 0, where x & y are the variables. But a linear equation in two variables can be written in different forms as long as there are two variables, ex: y = ax + b.\n",
    "* Slope-intercept form, or \"y-form\", is a linear equation in two variables that's formatted as y = mx + b\n",
    " * When a linear equation is solved for y, the coefficient of the x term is the slope, represented as m rather than 'a', and the constant term, b, is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. \n",
    "* To convert an equation to slope-intercept form, simply solve for y.\n",
    "* Any equation formatted in this way automatically gives you a point & the slope.\n",
    "* Example: For the equation $y = \\frac{1}{2} + 3$\n",
    " * $m = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    " * y-intercept = (0,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Point-Slope Formula\n",
    "* Used to convert points into an equation.\n",
    "* If you have the coordinates of 1 point and the slope of a line, you can calculate the equation of a line.\n",
    "* Formula: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n",
    "* Example: Find the equation for a line with a point (3, 2) and a slope of 2.\n",
    " * y - 2 = 2(x - 3)\n",
    " * y - 2 = 2x - 6\n",
    " * y = 2x - 6 + 2\n",
    " * y = 2x - 4\n",
    "* Since the equation is in slope-intercept form, we have another point, the y-intercept (0,4), to graph a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphing Linear Equations\n",
    "* The solutions for linear equations are in ordered pair form (x,y), which are used to graph a line of the equation.\n",
    "* Use an optimal method to find 3 points depeding on the equation \n",
    " * Solve for at least 3 points to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "* Point-plot the ordered pair solutions in the table.\n",
    "* Draw a line through the points, extending the line to fill the grid &/or drawing arrows on both sides of the line to show indefinte extention.\n",
    "* If the line isn't straight, something went wrong, & you need to recheck calculations or replot the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing an optimal method for getting points\n",
    "* There are many ways to get point coordinates for a linear equation, the most optimal of which depends on the format &/or variables of an equation, or its slope.\n",
    " * If the equation has only one variable, the value is constant, & it is a vertical or horizontal line.\n",
    " * If both x & y are on the same side of the equation (of the form ax + by = c), use the intercepts & sub x for any number for the 3rd point.\n",
    "   * Note that fractions are more difficult to graph because they require more precision. If an equation has both variable on one side, isolate the variable that doesn't have a coefficient to avoid getting fractional cooridinates.\n",
    " * If y is isolated on one side of the equation, use slope-intercept form.\n",
    " * If the slope & 1 point are given instead of an equation, use the slope method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Real World Applications of Slope-Intercept\n",
    "* Many real-world applications are modeled by linear equations. \n",
    "* Usually when a linear equation models a real-world situation, different letters are used for the variables, instead of x and y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temperature Conversion\n",
    "* $F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$, where F is Fahrenheit scale and C is the Celsius scale.\n",
    "* Convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit by substituting a C value & solving for F.\n",
    "* $m = \\frac{9}{5}$, means the temp Fahrenheit (F) increases 9 degrees when the temp Celsius (C) increases 5 degrees.\n",
    "* F-intercept = 32, means that when the temperature is 0° on the Celsius scale, it is 32° Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Female Height by Shoe Size\n",
    "* h = 2s + 50, where h is height and s is shoe size.\n",
    "* Estimates female height based on shoe size.\n",
    "* m = 2, means that the height, increases by 2 inches when the shoe size increases by 1.\n",
    "* h-intercept = 50, means that when the shoe size is 0, the height is 50 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temperature by Cricket Chirps\n",
    "* $T = \\frac{1}{4}n + 40$, where T is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and n is number of cricket chirps per minute.\n",
    "* $m = \\frac{1}{4}$, means that the temp increases 1 degree when the number of chirps increases by 4 per minute.\n",
    "* T-intercept = 40, means that when the number of chirps is 0, the temperature is 40° Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Example\n",
    "* The cost of running some types business has two components—a fixed cost and a variable cost. \n",
    " * The fixed cost is always the same regardless of how many units are produced. This is the cost of rent, insurance, equipment, advertising, and other items that must be paid regularly. \n",
    " * The variable cost depends on the number of units produced. It is for the material and labour needed to produce each item.\n",
    "* Example: Stella running a pizza business needs to determine the relationship between zir weekly cost and pizzas ze sells.\n",
    "* C = 4p + 25, where C is the weekly cost, in dollars, and p is the number of pizzas sold.\n",
    "* m = 4, means the cost increases by \\$4 for each pizza sold.\n",
    "* C-intercept = 25, is the fixed cost that exists even if ze sells no pizzas.\n"
