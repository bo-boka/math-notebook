    "* Long Division:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponentiation\n",
    "* Signifies repeated multiplication of a number upon itself. The number to be repeatedly multiplied is called the **base** and the amount of times it's to be multiplied with itself is called the **exponent** or the **power**. \n",
    "* Written either by separating the base and exponent with a carat, b^n, or with the power as a superscript, $b^n$ where b is the base and n is the exponent/power. Pronounced as \"b to the power of n\".\n",
    "* **Perfect Square** is any whole number taken to the power of 2.\n",

    "#### Simplifying Exponents\n",
    "* Generally, if the exponent $\\leq 3$, apply the exponent. If the exponent $\\geq3$, leave the answer in exponential form.\n",
    "* Any number with an exponent of 0 results in 1.\n",
    " * Example: $5^0 = 1$\n",
    "* For negative numbers with exponents that aren't wrapped in parenthesis, the sign of the result will be negative.\n",
    " * Example: $-3^4 = -(3 * 3 * 3 * 3) = -81$\n",
    "* For negative numbers with exponenets wrapped in parenthesis, the sign of the result is positive if the exponent is even and negative if the exponent is odd.\n",

    "* **Quotient Property of Exponents**: When dividing exponents where the bases are the same, if the denominator exponent is smaller, subtract it from the numerator. If the numerator exponent is smaller, subtract it from the denominator & put the result over 1. I.e. If a is a real number, a$\\ne$0, and m,n are whole numbers, then if m > n $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, else if m < n $\\frac{1}{a^{n-m}}$\n",

    " * Example: $\\frac{2^3}{2^5} = \\frac{1}{2^{5-3}} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$\n",
    "* **Negative Exponents**: Represents the case of Quotient Property of Exponents where the numerator exponent is smaller than the denominator. Instead of putting the altered result over 1, we use a negative exponent, although that's not its simplest form. I.e. If n is a positive integer and a$\\ne$0, then $\\frac{1}{a^n} = a^{-n}$\n",

    "   * < 1, the power will be $10^{-n}$ (negative)\n",
    "* To **convert large numbers**, move the decimal to the left until it's a number between 0-10, exclusive, & multiply that number by 10 to the power of the amount of times the decimal was moved.\n",

    "* **Square Root** is a number multiplied by itself only once to get a square are used most commonly such that the radical symbol without a specified degree is implied to be a square root operation, $\\sqrt{x}$. Pronounced as \"square root of x\" rather than \"2nd root of x\". See below for more detail.\n",
    "* **Cube Root** is a number multiplied by itself twice. Written as $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and pronounced as \"cube root of x\" rather than \"third root of x\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Square Roots\n",
    "* aka 'positive square root' or 'principal square root'. \n",
    "* Every positive number has two square roots, a positive one and a negative one. \n",
    " * The 'Positive Square Root', aka the 'Pricipal Square Root' is represented with the radical symbol, $\\sqrt{x}$. \n",
    " * The negative square root is represented by placing a minus symbol in front of  the radical sign, $-\\sqrt{x}$\n",
    "* Cannot take a square root of a negative number because two positives multiplies are positive while two negatives multiplied also equal a positive. Rather, there is no \"Real Number\" solution (See Types of Numbers below).\n",
    "* For square roots that aren't perfect squares, we can either use relationship symbols to represent an approximation of value, or, if we use a calculator, the answer will be an approximate decimal and will require the approximation symbol (rather than the equals sign) and usually round to the nearest hundrenth decimal.\n",
    " * Example: $2 < \\sqrt{5} < 3$ \n",
    " * Example: $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24$\n",
    "* Area & Side Length of Squares: Since the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of any of its sides, likewise the length of a square's side(s) can be calculated by taking the square root of its area, $\\sqrt{A}$\n",
    " * Example: If the Area of a square = 9, then the length of its sides is $\\sqrt{9} = 3$\n",
    "* Gravity: On Earth, if an object is dropped from a height of h feet, the time in seconds it will take to reach the ground is found by evaluating the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{4}$\n",
    " * Example: If an object is dropped from a height of 64 feet, the amount of seconds for it to reach the ground is $\\frac{\\sqrt{64}}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$ seconds.\n",
    "* Car Accident Investigation: Using square root formula with skid mark distance can determine the speed the car was going before applying the brakes. According to some formulas, if the length of the skid marks is d feet, then the speed of the car, in mph, can be found by evaluating $\\sqrt{24d}$\n",
    " * Example: If skid marks were 190 ft, the speed of the car (in mph) before braking is $\\sqrt{24(190)} = \\sqrt{4560} = 67.527772...$. The rounded speed is 67.5 mph\n"

    "* **Integers** (Z): set of all whole numbers plus all the negatives (or opposites) of the natural numbers, i.e. {… , ⁻2, ⁻1, 0, 1, 2, …}\n",
    "* **Rational Numbers** (Q): any number that can be represented as a fraction, where the top and bottom numbers are integers & the denominator is not 0, e.g. 1/2, 3/4, 7/2, ⁻4/3, 4/1 \n",
    " * This includes all integers since they can be represented as a fraction with a denominator of 1 in the case of non-zero numbers, and a fraction with the numerator of 0 in the case of 0.\n",
    " * This also includes decimals that end or have repeating digits.\n",
    " * But does not include decimals with infinite non-repeating digits.\n",
    " * Notice that \"ratio\" is in the name.\n",
    "* **Irrational Numbers**: numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction, e.g. $\\pi$, $\\sqrt2$, $\\sqrt{3}$, n\n",
    "* **Real Numbers** (R): (also called measuring numbers or measurement numbers). Includes all rational, & irrational numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.\n",
    "* **Complex Numbers** (C): numbers which have both real and imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete vs Continuous Numbers\n",
    "The above types of number sets can be split up into discrete or continuous numbers.\n",
    "* N, W, Z and Q are referred to as discrete. This means that they are separate and distinct entities & each of these sets is countable.\n",
    "* The last set, R, cannot be counted. This is because they are continuous. Between any two real numbers, however close they may be, there are infinitely more real numbers.\n",

    "# Integers\n",
    "* Type of rational number, comprising of all whole numbers (which include natural numbers) as well as the negatives of the natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Integers\n",
    "* **Even Numbers**: Numbers that are multiples of 2.\n",
    "* **Odd Numbers** numbers: Numbers which are not multiples of 2 & leave 1 as the remainder when divided by 2.\n",
    "* **Prime Numbers**: Any number other than 1 which does not have any factor apart from one and the number itself is called a prime number.\n",
    " * **Co-prime/Relatively Prime Numbers**: Two numbers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if they do not have any common factor other than one.\n",
    "* **Composite Numbers**: a number that has more than two distinct factors.\n",
    "* **Perfect Numbers** are equal to the sum of their “proper” divisors (positive integers that divide a number evenly, not counting itself). For example, 6 = 3 + 2 + 1, and 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept: Multiples & Factors\n",
    "* A **factor** of a number is the number that divides it completely without leaving any remainder.\n",
    " * Two numbers that we multiply together to get a certain product are called **factor pairs**. \n",
    "* A **multiple** of a number is the product of the number and a counting number\n",
    "* Notice that the Types of Integers are relative to their factors & multiples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern of Multiples\n",
    "* 2: even numbers\n",
    "* 3: has a sum of digits that is multiple of 3\n",
    "* 5: last digit is either 0 or 5\n",
    "* 6: is divisible by both 2 and 3\n",
    "* 10: the last digit is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factorization\n",
    "* Determining all the factors of a number\n",
    "* We can find all the factors of any counting number by systematically dividing the number by each counting number, starting with 1. If the quotient is also a counting number (whole number), then the divisor and the quotient are factors of the number. We can stop when the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor because the factors will start to duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining Primality\n",
    "* Determining if a number is a prime number.\n",
    "* Whole Numbers are either prime or composite, with the exception of 1, which is neither. All composite numbers have prime factors. So, if a number has a prime factor, it's not a prime & is instead a composite.\n",
    "* For quick determination of some numbers, we can use patterns of multiples for 2, 3, & 5. \n",
    " * Even numbers (except 2) are composite.\n",
    " * If the sum of the number's digits is a multiple of 3, it's composite.\n",
    " * If the number ends in 5 or 0, it's composite.\n",
    "* For complete determination, we use the same process used in factorization except divide the number by prime numbers until the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor. If no primes divide evenly, the number is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prime Factorization\n",
    "* every composite number can be written as a unique product of primes\n",
    "* can either be written by specifying each prime separated by a mulitplication sign or in exponential form.\n",
    "* find prime factorization of a number using the ladder method\n",
    " * To begin building the “ladder,” divide the given number by its smallest prime factor. To add a “step” to the ladder, we continue dividing by the same prime until it no longer divides evenly. Then we divide by the next prime. Continue dividing up the ladder in this way until the quotient is prime.\n",
    " * Example: Find Prime Factorization of 36\n",
    "   * 36/2=18, 18/2=9, 9/3= 3\n",
    "   * Take all the divisors & the last quotient: 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = $2^2 * 3^2$\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Least Common Multiple (LCM)\n",
    "* A common multiple of two numbers is a number that is a multiple of both numbers. The LCM is the smallest of the common multiples of those numbers.\n",
    "* Useful when adding/subtracting fractions with different denominators.\n",
    "* Find the LCM in smaller numbers by seeing if the smaller number is a divisor of the larger. If so, the larger number is the LCM. If not, multiply the larger number by 2 and check again.\n",
    "* Find the LCM in small or large numbers by using the Prime Factor Method. To do this, find the Prime Factorization of both numbers. If there are repeating factors between numbers, we're only using each factor once. That is, use repeated factors from the same number, but don't take those factors again from the second number (can use columns to determine this). Then multiply those factors together. The product is the LCM.\n",
    " * Exmaple: Find the LCM of 12 and 18\n",
    "   * 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 ....\n",
    "   * 18 = 2 * .... 3 * 3\n",
    "   * Since both numbers have both 2's & 3's, we're only taking the largest amount for each. 12 has two 2's whereas 18 only has 1, so we keep 2 * 2. Likewise, 18 has two 3's whereas 12 only has one 3. so we keep 3 * 3. You can also think of these as columns where if you dropped down the numbers from each column, you'd get:\n",
    "   * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Greatest Common Factor (GCF)\n",
    "* Found similarly to finding the LCM, except after the columns are lined up, only keep the factors that occur in both sets.\n",
    " * Example: Use above for 12 and 18\n",
    "   * 2 and 3 are the duplicates.\n",
    "   * 2 * 3 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations on Negative Integers\n",
    "* Integers, unlike whole numbers (which are natural numbers and 0), can be negative. Another name for the set of natural numbers is positive integers.\n",
    "* Operations on negative integers have a different set of rules that affects their sign.\n",
    "* If the negative number comes after the operator sign, it's surrounded in parenthesis.\n",
    "* If the number(s) are surrounded in parenthesis with no operator sign, the operator is multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addition of Negative Integers\n",
    "* If the second number is a negative, the operator becomes subtraction\n",
    " * Example: 5 + (-2) = 3\n",
    "* 2 negative sum a negative\n",
    " * Example: -5 + (-2) = -7\n",
    "* When summing a positive & negative, if there is more negatives, sum is negative whereas more positives, the sum is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subtraction of Negative Integers\n",
    "* If the second number is a negative, the operator becomes addition (2 negatives = a positive)\n",
    " * Example: 5 - (-2) = 7\n",
    " * Exmaple: -5 - (-2) = -3\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Division & Multiplication of Negative Integers\n",
    "* In algebra, multiplication is usually represented using parenthesis.\n",
    "* Multiplying/Dividing 2 negatives, the product/quotient is positive.\n",
    " * Example: -2(-4) = 8\n",
    "* Multiplying/Dividing 1 negative & 1 positive, the product/quotient is negative.\n",
    " * Example: -2(4) = -8\n",

    "* Writing a number as a decimal is known as decimal notation.\n",
    " * Note that decimals are usually rounded to the thousandth, unless otherwise specified or when working with money, in which case round to the hundredth.\n",
    "* Since the right of the decimal represents values less than 1, the place values grow smaller as you move to the right ascending each place in powers of 10. Note the figure below:\n",

    "## Adding/Subtracting Monomials\n",
    "* We can add or subtract monomials if they are like terms.\n",
    "* Terms are called **Like Terms** if they have the same variables and exponents. All constant terms are also like terms. Radicals must have the same index AND radicand. Else, they're **Unlike Terms**.\n",
    "* If a term has multiple variables or coefficients, the order of the variables/coefficients that aren't next to the exponent does not matter and they are still considered like terms, as per the Associative Property of Multiplication.\n",

    "* When dividing exponents with the same base & the denominator exponent is smaller, subtract from numerator exponent. If numerator exponent is smaller, subtract from denominator exponent & put over 1, as per the 'Quotient Property of Exponenets'.
