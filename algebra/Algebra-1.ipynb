    "* Every point is represented by an **ordered pair** in parenthesis, the first number being the **x-coordinate** of the point, and the second number being the **y-coordinate**, i.e. (x,y). The phrase \"ordered pair\" implies that the order is important.\n",

    "## Slope\n",
    "* Visualy, slope is the steepness of a line.\n",
    "* Conceptually, slope is the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change between two points on the plane or a line. So, slope equals the ratio of the rise over the run, measuring the rate of change for a line.\n",
    "* **Rise**: Vertical change of a line (y-change).\n",
    "* **Run**: Horizontal change of a line (x-change).\n",
    "* **m**: Variable that's always used to represent slope.\n",
    "* Formula: $m = \\frac{rise}{run}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A line can slant upwards or downwards, but it is always read from left to right. Therefore, the rise can be positive or negative, but the run will always be positive. Thus, the rise determines the sign of a slope.\n",
    " * If a line slants upward, the slope is positive. \n",
    " * If a line slants downward, the slope is negative.\n",
    "* Slope is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the height & length of the sides are the rise & run, respectively. On a grid, if a line is vertical or horizontal, a right triangle cannot be formed because either the rise (height) or the run (length) is 0.\n",
    " * Horizontal lines have a slope of 0 because the rise is 0 and $\\frac{0}{x} = 0$ (0 divided by anything is 0).\n",
    " * Vertical lines have a slope of 'undefined' because the run is 0 and $\\frac{y}{0} = undefined$ (you can't divide by 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining Slope/Points/Lines Visually\n",
    "* The slope of a line on a grid can be determined by counting the rise & run from one point to the other.\n",
    " * Count the Rise: Start from the leftmost point and count the intervals vertically to the second point.\n",
    "  * If you count upward, the rise is positive.\n",
    "  * If you count downward, the ries is negative.\n",
    " * Count the Run: From the point you're at, count the intervals horizontally to the second point.\n",
    " * Put the rise over run in a fraction.\n",
    "* Likewise, a point on grid can be determined by counting in the same way using slope from another point. \n",
    " * For graphs with larger numbers, it's helpful to use a larger equivalent fraction of the slope for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slope Formula\n",
    "* If you have the coordinates of two points, you can get the slope by subtracting the first point from the second point to get the rate of change. \n",
    "* Formula: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\n",
    "* You will get the same answer regardless of which point is subtracted from which.\n",
    "* Example: Find the slope of (1, 2) and (3, 5)\n",
    " * $m = \\frac{5-2}{3-1}$\n",
    " * $m = \\frac{3}{2}$\n",
    "* The slope formula is the same as $m = \\frac{rise}{run}$ because rise represents a 'change in y' and run represents a 'change in x'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Points Given a Point & Slope\n",
    "* If you have the coordinates of 1 point and the slope of a line, you can calculate other points on the line to graph, since y is associated with the rise & x with the run.\n",
    "* Unofficial Formula: $(x_1,y_1) = (x + run, y + rise)$\n",
    "* To get the second point for a graph, you add the slope to the given point by adding the rise to y and the run to x. You can add the slope again to the result for a third point.\n",
    "* Example: For a point, (3, 2), and a slope of 2, find another point.\n",
    " * $(x_1,y_1) = (3 + 1, 2 + 2)$\n",
    " * $(x_1,y_1) = (4,4)$\n",
    " * $(x_2,y_2) = (4 + 1, 4 + 2)$\n",
    " * $(x_2,y_2) = (5,6)$\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Slope-Intercept Form\n",
    "* Used to easily determine slope & y-intercept.\n",
    "* The standard form of a linear equation in two variables is ax + by + c = 0, where x & y are the variables. But a linear equation in two variables can be written in different forms as long as there are two variables, ex: y = ax + b.\n",
    "* Slope-intercept form, or \"y-form\", is a linear equation in two variables that's formatted as y = mx + b\n",
    " * When a linear equation is solved for y, the coefficient of the x term is the slope, represented as m rather than 'a', and the constant term, b, is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. \n",
    "* To convert an equation to slope-intercept form, simply solve for y.\n",
    "* Any equation formatted in this way automatically gives you a point & the slope.\n",
    "* Example: For the equation $y = \\frac{1}{2} + 3$\n",
    " * $m = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    " * y-intercept = (0,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Point-Slope Formula\n",
    "* Used to convert points into an equation.\n",
    "* If you have the coordinates of 1 point and the slope of a line, you can calculate the equation of a line.\n",
    "* Formula: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n",
    "* Example: Find the equation for a line with a point (3, 2) and a slope of 2.\n",
    " * y - 2 = 2(x - 3)\n",
    " * y - 2 = 2x - 6\n",
    " * y = 2x - 6 + 2\n",
    " * y = 2x - 4\n",
    "* Since the equation is in slope-intercept form, we have another point, the y-intercept (0,4), to graph a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parallel Lines\n",
    "* Two lines that never intersect & have the same slope. \n",
    "* Denoted by comparisons:\n",
    " * is parallel with: $\\|$\n",
    " * is NOT paralell with: $\\nparallel$\n",
    " * the slope parallel to another line: $m_\\|$\n",
    "* Two lines that are linear equations in two variables are parallel when they have the same slope with different y-intercepts.\n",
    " * You can determine if lines are paralell by putting them into slope-intercept form. The slope should be the same, but the y-intercepts should be different.\n",
    "* Two lines that are linear equations in one variable, using the same variable, are always parallel.\n",
    " * Horizontal lines, e.g. y = 3 and y = -6, always have a slope of 0.\n",
    " * Vertical lines, e.g. x = -2 and x = 9, always have a slope of undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perpendicular Lines\n",
    "* Two lines that intersect at a 90$^{\\circ}$ angle, i.e. their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. \n",
    "* Denoted by comparisons:\n",
    " * is perpendicular to: $\\perp$\n",
    " * is NOT perpendicular to: $\\not\\perp$\n",
    " * the slope perpendicular to another line: $m_\\perp$\n",
    "* Two lines that are linear equations in two variables are perpendicular when $m_1 * m_2 = -1$ and $m_1 = \\frac{-1}{m_2}$.\n",
    " * Determine if lines are perpendicular if one slope is the reciprocal of the other & they have opposite signs. If you multiply their slopes, the result is -1.\n",
    " * Example: $y = \\frac{1}{4}x - 1$ and $y = -4x + 2$\n",
    "* Two lines that are linear equations in one variable, with different variables, are always perpendicular.\n",
    " * x = 3 and y = 5 are perpendicular.\n",

    "## Graphing Linear Equations\n",
    "* The solutions for linear equations are in ordered pair form (x,y), which are used to graph a line of the equation.\n",

    " * Solve for at least 3 points to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "* Point-plot the ordered pair solutions in the table.\n",
    "* Draw a line through the points, extending the line to fill the grid &/or drawing arrows on both sides of the line to show indefinte extention.\n",
    "* If the line isn't straight, something went wrong, & you need to recheck calculations or replot the points.\n",
    "* Note: Examples in graphing section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing an optimal method for getting points\n",
    "* There are many ways to get point coordinates for a linear equation, the most optimal of which depends on the format &/or variables of an equation, or its slope.\n",
    " * If the equation has only one variable, the value is constant, & it is a vertical or horizontal line.\n",
    " * If both x & y are on the same side of the equation (of the form ax + by = c), use the intercepts & sub x for any number for the 3rd point.\n",
    "   * Note that fractions are more difficult to graph because they require more precision. If an equation has both variable on one side, isolate the variable that doesn't have a coefficient to avoid getting fractional cooridinates.\n",
    " * If y is isolated on one side of the equation, use slope-intercept form.\n",
    " * If the slope & 1 point are given instead of an equation, use the slope method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Real World Applications of Slope-Intercept\n",
    "* Many real-world applications are modeled by linear equations. \n",
    "* Usually when a linear equation models a real-world situation, different letters are used for the variables, instead of x and y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured.\n",

    "* Convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit by substituting a C value & solving for F.\n",
    "* $m = \\frac{9}{5}$, means the temp Fahrenheit (F) increases 9 degrees when the temp Celsius (C) increases 5 degrees.\n",

    "* h = 2s + 50, where h is height and s is shoe size.\n",
    "* Estimates female height based on shoe size.\n",
    "* m = 2, means that the height, increases by 2 inches when the shoe size increases by 1.\n",
    "* h-intercept = 50, means that when the shoe size is 0, the height is 50 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temperature by Cricket Chirps\n",
    "* $T = \\frac{1}{4}n + 40$, where T is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and n is number of cricket chirps per minute.\n",
    "* $m = \\frac{1}{4}$, means that the temp increases 1 degree when the number of chirps increases by 4 per minute.\n",
    "* T-intercept = 40, means that when the number of chirps is 0, the temperature is 40° Fahrenheit.\n",

    "#### Custom Example\n",
    "* The cost of running some types business has two components—a fixed cost and a variable cost. \n",
    " * The fixed cost is always the same regardless of how many units are produced. This is the cost of rent, insurance, equipment, advertising, and other items that must be paid regularly. \n",
    " * The variable cost depends on the number of units produced. It is for the material and labour needed to produce each item.\n",
    "* Example: Stella running a pizza business needs to determine the relationship between zir weekly cost and pizzas ze sells.\n",
    "* C = 4p + 25, where C is the weekly cost, in dollars, and p is the number of pizzas sold.\n",

    "   * Domain: {−3,0,1,2,4}\n",
    "   * Range: {−2,−1,3,4,5}\n",
    " * Notice the domain/range sets only have 5 values, rather than 6 because repeat numbers were omitted. \n",

    " * Example: Using the above relation:\n",
    "   * Domain: [-3,4]\n",
    "   * Range: [-2,5]\n",
    "* A mapping is sometimes used to show a relation, whereby a table of mismatched domains & ranges is matched by arrows to show the pairing of the elements of the domain with the elements of the range.\n",
    "* A graph can also be used to show relations by plotting the ordered pairs as points.\n",

    "* The same is not true for the range values, which can be assigned multiple domain values.\n",
    "* In a function, for each x,y ordered pair in the relation, each x-value is matched with only one corresponding y-value so there are no repeated elements in the domain, but multiple domain values may exist for a single range value.\n",
    " * Example: A table of people matched with their birthdays is a relation, but it's also a function. The domain is their names & the range is their birthdays. A person only has one birthday, but multiple people can have the same birthday.\n",
    " * The example in the relations section above is not a function because there are repeated elements in the domain (set of x-values).\n",

    "#### Function Notation\n",
    "* We use function notation to illustrate this concept, making it easier to read & understand.\n",
    "* It is very convenient to name a function and they're most commonly named f. Other common names are g, h, F, G, or H.\n",
    "* The most common input name is x.\n",
    "* For the function f, we write the range value y as $f(x)$, read \"f of x\" or \"the value of f at x\". So $y = f(x)$, read \"y is a function of x\".\n",
    " * Exmaple: The equation $y=4x-5$ where $y = f(x)$:\n",
    "   * Written: $f(x)=4x-5$ since y is a function of x.\n",
    "* The parentheses does not indicate multiplication; we're simply replacing the variable y with $f(x)$ to illustrate the functional relationship between the input and the output.\n",
    "* We call x the **independent variable** as it can be any value in the domain. We call f(x) the **dependent variable** as its value depends on x.\n",
    " * This concept is seen with linear equations in2V where the value of y is dependent on x. You can write them using function notation, although it isn't necessary.\n",
    "* The variables & functions can be named anything and represent many scenarios, as long as we're using parenthesis with a function to represent input and corresponding output.\n",
    " * Example: $h(a) =$ the next integer with the same 1st letter as input a.\n",
    "   * $h(2) = 3$\n",
    "   * $h(8) = 11$\n",
    "* The graph of the function is the graph of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $y=f(x)$, so we can write the ordered pairs as $(x,f(x))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining If An Equation Defines a Function\n",
    "* To distinguish a function from a relation or determine if an equation represents a function, it's most helpful to use the slope-intercept form of the linear equation. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y=mx+b. In function notation, this linear function becomes $f(x)=mx+b$ where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.\n",
    "* It is easiest to see if the equation is a function when it is solved for y. If each value of x results in only one value of y, then the equation defines a function.\n",
    " * Example: For 2x+y = 7, let x=3, which evaluates to y=1. Since y is one value, the equation is a function.\n",
    " * Example: For $x + y^2=3$, let x=2, simiplified is $y^2=1$, evaluates to $y = \\pm\\sqrt{1}$. Since square roots have 2 values, positive & negative, the equation is not a function of x.\n",
    " * Example: For $y=x^2+1$, let x=2, which evaluates to y=5. Since y is one value, the equation is a funciton.\n",
    "* Thus, equations where y is squared or has an even power are not functions, but the same is not true for x to an even power since x can have multiple values for y.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating Functions\n",
    "* The process of finding the value of $f(x)$ (the output) for a given value of x (an input) is called **evaluating the function**.\n",
    "* When substituting a value for x to determine the y-value, we replace all the x variables with the assigned value, including the x in the function name. Again, the name does not represent multiplication & does not affect the evaluation of the equation. It's only the name & the equation is evaluated per usual.\n",
    " * Example: For $f(x) = 4x-5$, evaluate $f(2)$\n",
    "   * Written: $f(2) = 4(2)-5$ \n",
    "   * Evaluated: $f(2) = 3$\n",
    "   * Read: \"The value of the function at x=2 is 3.\"\n",
    "* The same rules apply for substituting variables.\n",
    " * Example: For the function $g(x)=3x-5$, evaluate $g(h^2)$.\n",
    "   * Evaluated: $g(h^2)=3h^2-5$\n",
    "* Similarly, for expressions:\n",
    " * Example: For the function $g(x)=3x-5$, evaluate $g(x+2)$.\n",
    "   * Evaluate: $g(x+2)=3(x+2)-5$\n",
    "   * Simplify: $g(x+2)=3x+6-5$\n",
    "   * Simplify: $g(x+2)=3x+1$\n",
    "* When adding 2 functions as a function, evaluate both and add. Solve for any x constants first then add that to the original:\n",
    " * Example: For the function $g(x)=3x-5$, evaluate $g(x)+g(2)$.\n",
    "   * Find $g(2)$ first: $g(2) = 3(2)-5$\n",
    "   * $g(2) = 1$\n",
    "   * Add: $g(x)+g(2) = 3x-5+1$, where the 1 at the end is g(2)\n",
    "   * Simplify: $g(x)+g(2) = 3x-4$\n",
    "     * Notice that $g(x+2) \\neq g(x)+g(2)$\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving Functions for Inputs\n",
    "* While evaluating functions generally means solving for $f(x)$ or y, solving for the inputs of a funtions means finding the value(s) of x when given the value for $f(x)$.\n",
    "* To solve for the x inputs, replace the entire function name, $f(x)$, with the value given (rather than just replacing the x value when evaluating for y) and then solve for x. Like evaluating functions, finding x inputs for functions can be rewritten with the x value in the function name and the y value on the right hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since functions will only have one y value for any x value, but can have many x values for any y value, many functions have higher degrees for x, i.e. quadratic+.\n",
    "* Solving quadratic functions is similar to solving quadratic equations where you can use factoring and the zero product property after replacing the function name with the y-value. This will give you 2 values for x that correlate with 1 y value and can be used as ordered pairs for points on a graph.\n",
    "* Example: Solve $f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 2$ when $f(x) = 6$ and identify 2 points on the graph of the function.\n",
    " * Replace function name: $6 = x^2 + 2x - 2$\n",
    " * Put in quadratic standard form (one side 0): $x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0$\n",
    " * Factor trinomial: $(x - 2)(x + 4) = 0$\n",
    " * Express factors as equations for 0: $x - 2 = 0$ and $x + 4 = 0$\n",

    "## Graph of a Function\n",
    "* Since a function can have multiple x-values to a y value but cannot have multiple y-values to an x-value, we can use the **vertical line test** to determine if a graph is a function. A vertical line drawn through the graph should only hit a y-value once.\n",
    "* There will only be 1 y-intercept, but can have multiple x-intercepts.\n",
    "  * x-intercepts occur when y=0, so the x-intercepts occur when $f(x)=0$.\n",
    "  * y-intercept occurs when x=0, so the y-intercept occurs at $f(0)$\n",
    "* The y-coordinate of a point is the function of its x-coordinate.\n",

    "* **Range**: Aka, image. The actual outputs of a function based on logic. The range is a subset of the codomain.\n",

    "#### Importance of Codomain\n",
    "* An equation may or may not be a function depending on the outputs we allow.\n",
    " * Example: The square root function may have a negative and positive output, but a function cannot have multiple outputs.

Since the square of a number cannot be negative, the range of a square function is all non-negative real numbers, i.e. the y-value can never go below zero.

    " * A function is one-to-one if each value in the range corresponds to, at most, one element in the domain. For each ordered pair in the function, each y-value is matched with only one x-value and vice versa. There are no repeated y-values or x-values.\n",
    "* There may also be unmatched codomain values, i.e. the range and codomain needn't be equal, and thus is also called an **injective** funciton.\n",
    "* Just like the vertical line test on a graph can determine whether a relation is a function, the **horizontal line test** require a horizontal line to pass through only 1 y-value.\n",

    " * Note that the parenthesis around the function name are sometimes omitted.\n",
    "* One example of composing functions is transformations (Quadratic Function section), whereby a basic graph function is shifted a number of units. For $g(x) = x^2$ and $f(x) = x - 4$, the composition is defined by $(f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$, giving an output of $f(g(x)) = x^2 - 4$.\n",

    "#### Evaluating Compositions \n",
    "* When evaluating composite functions, we're evaluating from the inside out of the parenthesis, or aka from right to left of the function definition. After evaluating the innermost function, it's output becomes the input of the function wrapping it. Thus the order of functions matters. \n",

    "* Example: For $f(x) = x+2$ and $g(x) = x^2−3x−4$, find $(f*g)(2)$.\n",
    " * Rewrite: $(f*g)(2) = (x+2)(x^2−3x−4)$\n",
    " * Substitue: $(f*g)(2) = ((2)+2)((2)^2−3(2)−4)$\n",
    " * Simplify: $(f*g)(2) = (4)(-6)$\n",
    "   * Solve: $(f*g)(2) = -24$\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Dividing Polynomial Functions\n",
    "* When dividing functions without a remainder, use the same methods as you would a regular polynomial. If the domain value is given, it's best to substitute before to avoid long division with equations. I.e. for functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x)\\neq0$, $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$\n",
    "* See Rational Functions section in Algebra-2 notebook for more.\n",
    "* Example: For functions $f(x) = x^2−5x−14$ and $g(x)=x+2$, find $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(-4)$.\n",
    " * Rewrite: $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(x) = \\frac{x^2−5x−14}{x+2}$\n",
    " * Substitute: $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(-4) = \\frac{(-4)^2−5(-4)−14}{(-4)+2}$\n",
    " * Simplify: $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(-4) = \\frac{22}{-2}$\n",
    "   * Solve: $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(-4) = -11$\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Finding the Remainder\n",
    "* The **Remainder Theorem** states that if a polynomial function, $f(x)$, is divided by a linear factor, $x-c$, then the remainder is $f(c)$.\n",
    " * When the divisor is written as x−c, the value of the function at c, $f(c)$, is the same as the remainder from the division problem.\n",
    "* Find c and then plug it into the function to find the remainder.\n",
    " * Note if the divisor has a plus operator, rather than a minus, c will be a negative in x-c form.\n",
    "* Example: Divide the function $f(x) = x^3+3x+19$ by the factor $x+2$.\n",
    " * Rewrite divisor in x-c form: $x+2$ can be written as $x-(-2)$\n",
    " * Find c: $c = -2$\n",
    " * Evaluate f(c): $f(-2) = (-2)^3+3(-2)+19$\n",
    "   * Solve: $f(-2) = 5$\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Finding a Factor\n",
    "* The **Factor Theorem** states that for any polynomial function, $f(x)$, if $x-c$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(c)=0$.\n",
    "* Use the same process used in the Remainder Theorem. If the remainder is 0, the divisor is a factor of the function.\n",
    "* Example: Determine if $x-4$ is a factor of $f(x) = x^3-64$.\n",
    " * Rewrite divisor in x-c form: $x-4$ is already in x-c form.\n",
    " * Find c: $c=4$\n",
    " * Evaluate f(c): $f(4) = (4)^3-64$\n",
    "   * Solve: $f(4) = 0$ The divisor is a factor.\n",

    "## Function Real-World Applications\n",
    "* There will only be one solution when evaluating the function for y, but possibly more when solving for x, e.g. quadratic.\n",
    "* Use the same word problem strategies, except analyze the solutions to see which fit the situation, i.e. negative numbers may not apply to some real world scenarios.\n",

    "#### Every-day Problems\n",
    "* Example: The number of unread emails in Sylvia’s account is 75. This number grows by 10 unread emails a day. The function $N(t)=75+10t$ represents the relation between the number of emails, N, and the time, t, measured in days. Determine the independent & dependent variable and find $N(5)$.\n",

    " * Translate: $f(n) = n^2 + 2n$ when $f(n) = 323$ \n",
    " * Substitue f(x) : $323 = n^2 + 2n$\n",

    " * Identify: l and w when l * w = 117 and w + 4 = l, so w(w+4) = 117, quadritic means 2 solutions, but negative numbers don't apply to some real world scenarios.\n",
